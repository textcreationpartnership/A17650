            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ARGVMENT ON THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here haue beene diuers opinions in times paſt, not onely touching the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors name of this Epiſtle: but alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Epiſtle it ſelf hath bin receiued with much adoe; and that very lately amongſt them of the Latine churches. They had it in ſuſpition, as if it fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the error of <hi>Nouatus,</hi> touching the deniall of pardon vnto thoſe which fell backe againe into ſinne: but when we ſhall come to thoſe places where this matter is ſpoken of, we will ſhewe that this their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition was cauſeleſſe. Nowe for mine owne part, I doe receiue it without any difficultie at all amongſt the Apoſtolicall Epiſtles; and doe make no doubt but that it came to paſſe by the craft and ſubtiltie of the Diuell, that there haue beene ſome heretofore which haue indeauoured to out off this Epiſtle from the number of the Canonicall Bookes. For there is no booke in all the holy Scripture, which more clearely, or liuely ſpeaketh of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt: neither yet any which doth more highly extoll the dignitie, and vertue of his onely Sacrifice, the which he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp by his death: neither is there any booke which handleth more fully, both the vſe and the abrogating of Ceremonies: In a word, none which inſtructeth vs better, that Chriſt is the ende of the Lawe. Let vs not then by any means ſuffer that the Church of God and we with it, ſhould be depriued of ſo great a benefit: but on the contrarie, let vs hold it faſt, and carefully keepe it. Nowe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7791:4"/>we neede not much buſie our ſelues in ſtanding to diſcuſſe who was the Author of it, ſome haue thought that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Author of it; ſome others S. <hi>Luke;</hi> others <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and others <hi>Clement;</hi> as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> declareth. Although <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the ſixth booke of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, maketh mention but of S. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Clement.</hi> I know very well that ſince <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> time, it hath beene wholy receiued of the Greekes amongſt the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> but the Latines were of another opinion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen amongſt thoſe which were neereſt to the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. To ſpeake what I thinke, I cannot beeleue that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Author of it. For there is no great likelihood, to ſay as ſome doe, that he ſuppreſſed his name of ſet purpoſe, becauſe it was odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hatefull among the Iewes. And if this had beene ſo, why then ſhould he make mention of <hi>Timothy?</hi> for by this onely word he had diſcouered himſelfe, and had laid himſelfe open ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their knowledge.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe, the manner of teaching, as alſo his ſtyle, doth giue apparant teſtimonie that it was not of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> writing, but of ſome other mans doing: for he which wrote it, confeſſeth in the ſecond Chapter, that he was one of the Diſciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: now this is very farre off from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> manner of ſpeech. Moreouer the vſe and cuſtome of the Catechiſme, which he toucheth in the ſixth Chapter, cannot properly agree to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time. There are alſo other reaſons, which we will touch when we ſhall come to the places that giue occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I know the excuſe very well which ſome are wont to bring tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſtyle; to wit, that the difference thereof, doth giue no ſufficient ground to ſtay our iudgements vpon, becauſe that S. <hi>Luk,</hi> or ſome other did tranſlate this Epiſtle out of the Hebrew tongue into the Greeke. But it is eaſie to refute this their conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. I willingly let paſſe other places which are alleadged out of the Scripture: onely I ſay, that if this Epiſtle had beene written in Hebrew, there could not haue beene an alluſion in this word <hi>Teſtament,</hi> whereupon the author of this Epiſtle doth ſtay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. I ſay then, that which he handleth touching the nature of the Teſtament in the ninth Chapter, cannot be drawne out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other fountaine then from the Greeke word. For the Greeke
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7791:4"/>word ſignifieth two things, to wit, Teſtament, and Couenant: but <hi>Berith</hi> after the Hebrewes, ſignifieth Couenant onely. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will ſatisfie thoſe that are of ſound iudgement to prooue that which I haue ſaid: to wit, that this Epiſtle was written in the Greeke tongue. As touching that which is brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, that it is more probable that the Apoſtle would not write to the Iewes but in their owne tongue, this hath no more ground then the reſt. How few were then to be found which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the language of their aunceſtours? Againe, according to the region where euery one dwelt, ſo had he alſo learned the language of the ſame. Now the Greeke tongue was ſpread fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt abroad, and was more in vſe then any other. I therefore come now to the Argument it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt we haue to obſerue that the point whereat the Apoſtle aimeth, is not to perſwade the Iewes, that Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> was the Chriſt, and the Redeemer which had beene promiſed them. For in as much as he wrote vnto them which had alreadie made profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, he takes this article as wholy granted. But his onely drift is to prooue vnto them, what Chriſt his office is, to the ende they might thereby acknowledge that the obſeruation of the ceremonies, were aboliſhed by his comming. We muſt of neceſſitie note this diſtinction. For albeit it had beene a ſuperfluous labour in the Apoſtle, in ſpeaking to thoſe which were then ſufficiently perſwaded that Ieſus which was already manifeſted was that Chriſt; to buſie himſelfe in proouing the ſame point ſtill vnto them: yet it was neceſſarie, that he ſhould declare vnto them what this Chriſt was: becauſe they did not as yet vnderſtand the end; the vertue, nor the fruit of his comming. But whileſt they beguiled themſelues with a falſe expoſition of the lawe; in ſtead of taking the ſolide bodie and ſubſtance, they reſted themſelues in the ſhadow; and contented themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The like difference haue we at this day with the Papiſts: for they confeſſe indeed with vs that Chriſt is the ſonne of God, which was promiſed to be the Redeemer of the world: but when we come to ioyne iſſue, as they ſay, they diſpoyle him of more then the one halfe of his power.</p>
            <p>But to the matter; he doth purpoſely begin his ſpeach with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7791:5"/>dignitie, and greatnes of Chriſt, becauſe the Iewes were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that there was no reaſon why the law ſhould be in leſſe eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the Goſpel. Firſt of all then, he confirmes the Article whereupon the diſputation was: to wit, that the doctrine brought by Chriſt ought to haue the ſoueraigne place, becauſe it is the ſhutting vp and concluſion of all Propheſies. But leaſt the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which they bare to Moſes, might be ſome hindrance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in this behalfe, he ſhewes that Chriſt is much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than all others.</p>
            <p>And hauing touched in briefe, wherein he is more excellent, he doth purpoſely ſubiect the Angels vnderneath him, to the end that all others with them, might be brought vnder, and abaſed in regard of Chriſt. Now this manner of proceeding which he vſeth, is very fit; and not without great reaſon. For if he had begunne the compariſon with <hi>Moſes;</hi> it would haue beene very odious: but after he hath ſhewed by the ſcriptures, that euen the heauenly principalities are beneath Chriſt; there is neither <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> nor any man els whatſoeuer, which ought to refuſe to be ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them, that ſo the Sonne of God may haue the chieftie aboue all, both Angels and men. And therfore after the Apoſtle hath brought in the Angels vnder the rule and power of Chriſt; forthwith, as taking more courage vnto him, he comes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and to expreſſe how much more <hi>Moſes</hi> is inferiour: to wit, the difference is as much as is betweene the maſter and the ſeruant. Thus then, when we ſhall perceiue that he alwaies pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Chriſt in the ſoueraigne degree of principalitie, in the firſt three Chapters, let vs knowe that he aimeth at nothing but this, that when Chriſt ſpeaketh, all others ſhould hold their peace, and that nothing ſhould hinder vs to giue our whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his doctrine. Although when he ſets him before vs, as our brother in our fleſh, chap. <hi>2.</hi> he calles and allures vs alſo by this meanes, to the end we ſhould frame our ſelues vnder his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and giue our ſelues wholy vnto him. Now he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingles Exhortations, and threatnings for their ſakes that are dull and ſlouthfull to obey, or; who do obſtinately reſiſt. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is continued almoſt to the ende of the fourth Chapter. From thence he beginnes to expound the Prieſthood of Chriſt: the true
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7791:5"/>and pure knowledge whereof aboliſheth all the ceremonies of the lawe. But hauing onely in briefe ſhewed how amiable the lawe ought to be vnto vs, and with what contentment of mind we may be bold to reſt our ſelues in the ſame, he digreſſeth a little from his purpoſe to blame the Iewes, who like little children, did yet alwaies buſie themſelues in the firſt rudiments. Where he alſo ſtriketh them with terrour, by thundring out a moſt ſharpe and fearefull threatning againſt them: For he ſhewes that they ſtand in great danger to be reiected of the Lord, if they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be ſo ſlouthfull in profiting. But by and by after, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwageth this ſharpneſſe, ſaying, that he hath good hope, that they would become better. And this is to the ende he might rather encourage them to goe on forward, than to beate them downe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. Then he returnes againe to ſpeake of the Prieſthood of Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt he ſhews that it differs from the ancient Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which was vnder the lawe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, that it was more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe it ſucceeded in the place of the other, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by othe; that it is eternall, and hath alwaies his force, and efficacie: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, becauſe he that exerciſeth this office, ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Aaron,</hi> and all others of the tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> in dignitie and honour. Of all which things he ſhewes that there was an Image and ſhadow in the perſon of <hi>Melchiſedecke.</hi> Now to the ende he might the more certainely prooue that the ceremonies of the lawe were aboliſhed, he ſhewes how they, as alſo the Tabernacle, were inſtituted to another end, to wit, to ſerue to the heauenly paterne, to which all was referred. Whence it followes, that they were not to be reſted in, vnleſſe we would ſtand at a ſtay in the midde way, making no reckoning to come to the marke. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this matter, he alleadgeth the place of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> wherein there is promiſe made of a new Teſtament, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the correction of the olde. Whence it followes, that the old was earthly and weake. So conſequently comming to ſhew the ſimilitude, and agreement, which is betweene the ſhadowes and the ſubſtance which was manifeſted in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he concludes that all the ceremonies ordained by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were aboliſhed by his ſacrifice; becauſe the efficacie and vertue thereof is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and that in it is not onely contained the perfect and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7791:6"/>of the new Teſtament, but alſo the true and ſpirituall accompliſhment of that externall prieſthood, which was in force and had place vnder the lawe. Vnto the doctrine he addeth yet another exhortation, which he vſeth as a ſpurre to pricke them forward, to the end, that renouncing all impediments, they might receiue Chriſt with ſuch reuerence as was meete. As touching ſo many examples of the fathers, which he reciteth in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth chapter, I thinke he alleadgeth them of purpoſe to giue the Iewes to vnderſtand, that if ſo be they were to paſſe from <hi>Moſes</hi> vnto Chriſt, it would be ſo far off, that they ſhould decline from the holy Fathers, that by this meanes rather they ſhould be the more neerely conioyned with them. For if faith were the principal vertue which was in the fathers, yea the very roote of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; it follows then, that it is this faith alſo, by which they ſhould eſpecially be acknowledged for the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the Prophets. And contrariwiſe, that all thoſe which followed not the faith of thoſe fathers, were baſtards &amp; no children. And ſurely it is a point which greatly redoundeth to the praiſe of the Goſpell; yea, it ſhould cauſe vs alſo to haue it in ſo much the more eſtimation, in regard that therein we are found to be ſuch, as haue a ſweet accord, and ſocietie with the vniuerſall Church, which hath bin ſince the beginning of the world. The two laſt Chapters doe containe diuers directions for the rule of a good life: to wit, of hope, of bearing of the croſſe, of patience, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, of the acknowledgement of Gods benefits, of obedience, mercie, and other worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of loue; of chaſtitie, and all ſuch like things. Laſtly, he ſhuts vp his Epiſtle with a praier, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with puts them in hope of his comming to ſee them ſhortly.</p>

Now to the end we may vnderſtand this the better, let vs note the oppoſition of euery member: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, to the Prophets he oppoſeth the ſonne of God: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the fathers, we that haue liued ſince Chriſts comming: Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the diuers formes of ſpeaking to the fathers; to that laſt reuelation which is now brought vnto vs by Chriſt. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this diuerſitie, he propounds but one God; to the end no man ſhould thinke that the law was contrarie to the Goſpell, or that there ſhould be one author of the law, and another of the Goſpell. And that we may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7791:7"/>the ſumme of this propoſition, we will vſe this figure, enſuing:
<q>
                     <l>God ſpake</l>
                     <l>In olde time by the Prophets: — Now by his Sonne.</l>
                     <l>Then to the Fathers: —But now to vs.</l>
                     <l>Then many times: —Now in the laſt times.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This foundation beeing laid, you ſee the conſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betweene the law and the goſpel eſtabliſhed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, who is alwaies like vnto himſelfe, and his word, which is the ſure and vnchangeable truth, did ſpeake both to them, and to vs. But it ſhall not be amiſſe to note the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the fathers and vs: for in olde time God framed his ſpeech and ſtyle vnto them in another manner, and order, than he doth now vnto vs.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they had the miniſtrie of the Prophets: but to vs, he hath ordained his own Sonne, for an Ambaſſadour. So then in this regard, our eſtate is better than theirs was. Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> is reckoned among thoſe Prophets; but, as in the number of them, which are farre inferiour to the Sonne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, as concerning the manner of reuelation of the truth; we are alſo therein farre before them. For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of viſions, and all the reſt of that gouernment which was vnder the old Teſtament, was a ſigne vnto them, that their gouernment was not yet ſetled and eſtabliſhed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as it ſhould be afterward, when things were to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſetled wholly and perfectly. Hereunto appertains that which follows: <hi>At ſundrie times and in diuers manners God ſpake, &amp;c.</hi> for God would alwaies haue held and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued one manner of proceeding vnto the ende, if ſo be the ſame had beene full, and perfect in all points. It follows by conſequence therefore, that theſe diuerſities were ſignes of imperfection. Moreouer I take theſe words, <hi>At ſundrie times, and in diuers manners,</hi> ſo, as the firſt is to be referred to the diuers ſucceſſion of times; for the Greeke word, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it word for word, ſignifieth in many pieces: as it falleth out when they determine to ſpeake more fully of a matter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7791:7"/>in time to come. By the ſecond (in mine opinion) he ſignifies diuerſitie, both in the forme and manner of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>When he ſaith, that <hi>he hath ſpoken to vs in theſe laſt times,</hi> his meaning is, that we haue no more occaſion to hang in ſuſpence, as though we had need to waite for ſome new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation. For the word which Chriſt hath brought vnto vs, is not a treatiſe of ſome particular parts of doctrine, but it is the laſt cloſing vp, and perfect concluſion of all that which is needfull for vs to know vnto ſaluation. And in this ſenſe, the Apoſtles doe take the laſt dayes, and the laſt times; which thing <hi>Paul</hi> alſo teſtifies, where he ſaith that the ends of the world are come vpon vs, 1. Cor. 10.11. If ſo be then that God hath now ſpoken once for all, in theſe laſt times; we for our parts ought to hearken vnto it, and not onely ſo, but in giuing eare vnto it, we are alſo to ſettle and ſtay our ſelues in it, and neuer enquire further: which two poynts are not a little auayleable for vs to vnderſtand. For firſt the Iewes are greatly hindred, becauſe they conſider not that God hath deferred the reuelation of the perfect doctrine vnto theſe laſt times: and therefore contenting themſelues with their lawe, they ſet not themſelues forward to come home to the marke: on the other ſide although Chriſt be come, and is ſo receiued, yet an euill no leſſe pernitious than the former hath begun to reigne in the world: for men now deſire to ſeeke further than Chriſt; for I pray you what other thing is there in the whole Papacie, but a ſtraying beyond the limits which the Apoſtle here hath ſet vs? Wherefore euen as the ſpirit of God in this place ſommoneth all men to come to Chriſt: ſo alſo it forbids them to paſſe beyond the bounds of theſe laſt words here mentioned. In a word, the higheſt perfection of our wiſdome is to be bounded within the limits of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom he hath made heire of all things:]</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>2</label> He decketh Chriſt with his praiſes, thereby leading vs to giue him reuerence: for if the Father hath ſubiected all things vnder him, then we alſo doubtles doe belong to his iuriſdiction. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he ſheweth that there is no good thing out of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7791:8"/>he is the vniuerſall heire of the world. Oh how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched are we then, if Chriſt inrich vs not with his benefits! In the ſecond place he addes, that this honour doth of right belong to the ſonne of God, to haue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer all things, becauſe all things were created by him. Though I deny not but theſe two titles are attributed vnto Chriſt in diuers reſpects. For the world was created by him, becauſe he is the eternall wiſdome of God, which from the beginning of the world hath been the diſpoſer of all his workes. And from hence we may note the eternitie of Chriſt. For it is neceſſarie indeede that he ſhould be before he could create the world. But if we ſeeke the length of time, we ſhall finde no beginning thereof: now it doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all diminiſh his power, in that it is ſaid the world was made by him; which ſounds as though he made it not himſelfe. For it is a manner of ſpeech commonly vſed in the Scriptures, that the Father is called the Creator: and whereas in ſome places it is added, by his wiſdome, Prou. 8.27. By his word, Iohn 1.3. By the Sonne, Col. 1.16. It is all one as if wiſdome it ſelfe were called the Creator of the world. Yet notwithſtanding the diſtinction of the perſons is to be noted not onely in regard of vs, but euen as it is in God, betweene the Father and the Sonne. Thus then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vnitie of the eſſence it falleth out that whatſoeuer is eſſentiall in God, appertaines both to the Father, and to the Sonne: as likewiſe, that whatſoeuer ſimply appertaines vnto God, is common both to the one and to the other. And yet this hinders nothing at all, but that euery perſon ſhould haue his proprietie.</p>
               <p>Now the name <hi>heire</hi> is giuen to Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh, for in that he was made man, he thereby clothed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with our very nature: this right of being heire of the world was conferred vnto him, to this end that he thereby might recouer that againe for vs which wee had loſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> For in the beginning God appointed man as heire of all his benefits, as if he had been his ſonne: but the firſt man falling away from God by ſinne, depriued both himſelfe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7791:8"/>and all his ofſpring, not onely of Gods bleſſing, but of all good things themſelues, therefore doe wee then begin by good right to enioy theſe bleſſings from God, when Ieſus Chriſt who is the onely and vniuerſall heire, receiueth vs to haue communion with him. For for this cauſe is he become heire, to the end he might inrich vs with his benefits. Yea the Apoſtle himſelfe doth adorne him with this very title, to the end we might learne to know that without him, wee are naked and emptie of all good things. Whereas we haue tranſlated <hi>of all things:</hi> the Greeke word might bee as well of all: and then it giues vs to vnderſtand, that we ought to be ſubiect vnto Chriſt, becauſe the Father hath giuen vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. But I rather interpret it of <hi>all things,</hi> and ſo it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that we are thruſt out of the lawfull poſſeſſion of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, and of all creatures, till wee come to bee made one with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Who being the brightnes of the glorie, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graued forme of his perſon, and bearing vp al things by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie word, hath by himſelfe purged our ſinnes, and ſitteth at the right hand of the maiestie in the higheſt places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THeſe things are ſpoken partly of the diuine eſſence of Chriſt, and partly of his humane nature. For in that he is called <hi>the brightnes of the glorie, and the ingraued forme of his ſubſtance:</hi> it is proper to his diuinitie: the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing likewiſe appertaine to his humanitie. Yet the whole verſe containes notwithſtanding an high commendation of the dignitie and excellencie of Chriſt. Moreouer, looke by what reaſon he is called the brightnes of the glorie; by the ſame reaſon he is called the ingrauen forme of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Both which manners of ſpeech are borrowed from the creatures. For nothing can be ſaid of things ſo high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, vnleſſe we borrow ſome ſimilitudes from them. It is needleſſe therefore for vs to ſtand to diſpute ouer ſubtilly how the Sonne, who is of one eſſence with the Father, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the brightnes of his glorie.</hi> Wee muſt confeſſe that that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7791:9"/>which is transferred from the creatures to the maieſtie of God, is ſomething improper: yet is it no abſurditie that theſe things viſible to our ſenſes ſhould bee applied vnto God, to the end we might be taught thereby what we are to ſeeke in Chriſt, and what profit he brings vnto vs. For wee muſt know, that this place leades vs not to the ſeeking out of vaine ſpeculations; but to learne therein a true and ſure doctrine of faith. Therefore wee are to applie theſe titles of Chriſt to our profit: for it is for our ſakes that they are thus attributed vnto him. Doe wee heare then that the Sonne is called <hi>the brightnes of the glorie of his Father?</hi> Let vs thus thinke then in our ſelues: the glorie of the Father is to vs inuiſible, till ſuch time as it ſhine foorth vnto vs in Chriſt. Is he called the <hi>liuely image of his Fathers ſubſtance?</hi> It is to the end we might learne, that the maieſtie of the Father is hidden from vs, till ſuch time as he manifeſts the ſame vnto vs in this ingraued forme of his image. They which thinke not of this relation, and that theſe things are attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt as in reſpect of vs, doe diſpute ouer ſubtilly, and to no purpoſe: becauſe they vnderſtand not the meaning of the holy Apoſtle. For he doth not here take vpon him to ſhew what likenes of the Father the Sonne hath within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but as I haue ſaid, his meaning is to edifie our faith with fruite and profit: to the end we might learne that God is no otherwiſe manifeſted vnto vs, but in Chriſt. For ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite is that brightnes which is in the eſſence of God, that our eyes are dazeled therewith, till ſuch time as hee ſhineth vnto vs in Chriſt: whereof it followeth, that vnleſſe God ſhew vs his brightnes in Chriſt, we ſhall be vtterly blinded with the beholding of that light. And this indeede is a very profitable philoſophie, namely to learne the excellencie of Chriſt by a liuely feeling and certaine experience of faith. As much is to be ſaid as touching the other word, the <hi>ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued forme,</hi> as I haue ſaid. Thus then the Greeke word which is tranſlated <hi>brightnes,</hi> ſignifieth in this place no other thing than a viſible or ſhining light which our eyes are not able to beare: And the Greeke word which is tranſlated <hi>image,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7791:9"/>a liuely forme of that ſubſtance which is hid and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. By the firſt word then we learne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that out of Chriſt we can finde no light but rather meere darknes. For although God be the only light, wherewith we muſt be enlightened, yet there is no other meanes whereby he ſheddeth the ſame into vs, but by this ſplendancie of his Sonne, if I may ſo ſpeake. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> By the ſecond word we are admoniſhed, that God is truly and fully knowne in Chriſt. For hee is no darke or ſhadowiſh image of him, but the liuely ingraued forme; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling him naturally, as the money reſembles the ſtamp of the Coyne wherewithall it is ſtamped. Nay the Apoſtle ſaith more: to wit, that the ſubſtance of the Father is as it were ingrauen in Chriſt. The Greeke word which I haue tranſlated <hi>ſubstance</hi> (therein following others) in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſignifies not the being or eſſence of the Father, but the perſon. For it is vnapt to ſay, that the eſſence of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in Chriſt: ſeeing both the one and the other is but one ſimple eſſence. But it is proper and truly ſaid, that all that which the Father hath of his owne, is naturally ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Sonne: ſo that whoſoeuer hath the Sonne, hee hath alſo all that which is in the Father. Thus the ancient Fathers who taught faithfully, doe vſe this word <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> which is to ſay ſubſtance, or ſubſiſtence, in ſuch ſenſe as it ſhould be triple in God: and that this word <hi>ouſia,</hi> which ſignifies eſſence, is but one and ſimple in God. S. <hi>Hillarie</hi> doth euery where take this word ſubſtance for perſon. Now although it bee not the Apoſtles purpoſe in this place to ſhew what Chriſt is in himſelf, but ſuch a one as he declares himſelfe vnto vs by effect: yet notwithſtanding hee doth ſufficiently refute the Arrians and Sabellians when he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that vnto Chriſt which onely appertaines to God, and foorthwith notes out two diſtinct ſubſtances in the Father and in the Sonne. For from hence wee gather that he is one and the ſame God onely with the Father, and yet that there is a diſtinction notwithſtanding as touching the proprietie: ſo as both of them hath his ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And bearing vp all things]</hi> Properly it is, bearing al things.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7791:10"/>But the word to beare is taken to maintaine, or beare vp, and to cauſe all creatures to continue in their eſtate. For his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that all things would preſently fall to ruine, if they were not vpheld by his power. Notwithſtanding when he ſaith by his word, this may be expounded as well of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as of the Sonne: but becauſe the ſecond expoſition is the more receiued, and agreeth very well to the ſcope of the text, I am content to ſatisfie my ſelfe therein. Word for word it is by the word of his power: but according to the manner of the Hebrues, it is as much as if he had ſaid by his mightie word. For whereas ſome doe thus turne the text, that Chriſt maintaines all things by his Fathers word, that is, by himſelfe who is the word; it hath no colour at all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what neede is there of ſo conſtrained an expoſition? For when the Scripture calles Chriſt the word of the Father, it is not wont to vſe the word which is put here, that is, <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> but another, to wit, <hi>Logos.</hi> Wherefore the word doth here ſimply ſignifie to will: and the ſenſe is, that Chriſt who conſerues the world by his onely will, and as it were with his onely becke; notwithſtanding refuſed not to take vpon him the office by which he made the purgation of our ſins. And this is the ſecond member of the doctrine which is handled in this Epiſtle. For the maine groundworke of all the diſputation conſiſts in theſe two points: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that Chriſt ought to bee heard aboue all others, becauſe hee hath the chiefe and ſoueraign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> authoritie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that in as much as by his death he hath reconciled vs to his Father, hee hath thereby put an end to the old ſacrifices. Now where hee ſaith, <hi>by himſelfe:</hi> we muſt ſupplie an Antitheſis: to wit, that the ſhadowes of <hi>Moſes</hi> law were of no force to aſſiſt him in the doing of it. And hereby he ſhewes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the Leuiticall Prieſts: for it was alſo ſaid of them that they purged ſinnes: but they borrowed this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from another: to wit, from Chriſt. To be ſhort, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to exclude all other meanes, or helpes: in laying the power and price of the purgation of our ſinnes onely vpon Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:7791:10"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>And is ſet at the right hand.]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, after hee had obtained ſaluation for mankinde, he was receiued into the heauenly glorie, to the end he might gouerne all things. Now this is added, to ſhew that the ſaluation which he hath obtained is not temporarie. For otherwiſe it is our wont to meaſure his power by beholding of preſent things. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth vs then that wee ought not the leſſe to eſteeme Chriſt, becauſe he appeares not now before our eyes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thinke that the fulnes of his glorie conſiſts in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued, and exalted to this high and ſoueraigne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honour and rule: for the right hand is transferred vnto God by way of metaphor and ſimilitude: otherwiſe he is not ſhut vp in any place; neither hath he either right hand or left. When it is ſaid therefore that Chriſt is <hi>ſet,</hi> it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies that kingdome which is giuen him by his father, and that power whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention, to wit, that at his name euery knee ſhall bow, Phil. 2.10. Wherefore to be ſet at the right hand of the Father, is nothing elſe but to gouerne and rule in the ſtead of the Father; as the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Princes are wont to doe, to whom free and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power is giuen ouer all things. And therefore it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>of the maiestie, in the highest places:</hi> to ſignifie that Ieſus Chriſt is placed in the higheſt throne, wherein the maieſtie of God ſhineth. Wherefore as he ought to be loued for our redemption, ſo ought he to be adored in regard of this his Maieſtie.</p>

               <p>HAuing in the former verſes preferred Chriſt before <hi>Moſes</hi> and all others; now alſo by comparing him with the Angels, hee further amplifies his glorie. It was a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7791:11"/>thing familiarly knowne to the Iewes, that the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Angels. They heard that which was written of them as touching their honour throughout the whole Scriptures: And as the world is wonderfully enclined to ſuperſtition, ſo alſo is it wont many times to darken the glorie of God, by too much exalting of Angels. Good reaſon it is then that they ſhould be ſet in their proper place, leaſt they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way hinder the brightnes of Chriſt. And firſt of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle takes his argument from Chriſts name: to wit, that hee is much more excellent than the Angels, becauſe hee is the Sonne of God. Now he proues by two teſtimonies of Scripture, that Chriſt is adorned with this title: which two places wee will firſt examine, and afterward will gather the ſumme of the matter.</p>

                  <hi>this day &amp;c.]</hi> It cannot be denied but that this is ſpoken of <hi>Dauid:</hi> why? becauſe he repreſented the perſon of Chriſt. Therefore that which is written in this ſecond Pſalme, was figuratiue in <hi>Dauid:</hi> but all was liuely accompliſhed in Chriſt. For in regard that <hi>Dauid</hi> by ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many enemies, did thereby cauſe the limites of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ſpread round about from one ſide to another, hee therein was a figure of this promiſe; I will giue thee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thine inheritance. But what was this in reſpect of that large ſpreading of Chriſts kingdome, the bounds whereof ſtretch from the Eaſt to the Weſt? By the ſame reaſon <hi>Dauid</hi> was in like manner called the ſonne of God: that is to ſay, ſpecially choſen of God to performe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things. But this alas was ſcarſe one ſparkle of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which ſhined in Chriſt, in whom the Father hath ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his owne image. So that the name of Sonne, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine onely to Chriſt by a ſpeciall priuiledge: neither can it be transferred vnto any other whatſoeuer, but it ſhall be prophaned. For the Father hath ſet his ſeale on him, and vpon none elſe, Ioh. 6.27. Ioh. 10.36. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> But it may ſeeme that the argument of the Apoſtle is not yet firme enough: for whereupon doth he ground it to prooue that Chriſt is more excellent than the Angels, but vpon this that hee hath the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7791:11"/>name of <hi>Sonne?</hi>

<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6.</note> and ye all are the children of the moſt high. Or as if the Prophet ſpake not more honourably of Iſrael when hee calles him the firſt borne of God, Ierem. 31.9. for this title of ſonne is euery where attributed vnto him. Moreouer, <hi>Dauid</hi> in other places calles the Angels the ſonnes of God. Who is like the Lord among the ſonnes of the Gods? Pſal. 89.6. But the anſwere is eaſie: to wit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> that Princes are called by this name in regard of their preheminence: And Iſrael is ſo called to note out vnto vs the common grace of election: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in like manner are called the ſonnes of the Gods by a figuratiue kinde of ſpeech, becauſe they are celeſtiall ſpirits, who haue a certaine taſte of the diuinitie in the immortall bleſſednes. But when <hi>Dauid</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt calles himſelfe the ſonne of God ſimply without any addition, he therein notes out ſomething more peculiar and excellent than all the honour not only of all Iſrael, but of Princes and Angels alſo. Otherwiſe it were but an improper kinde of ſpeech and altogether vnfitting, if he ſhould be called the ſonne of God by way of excellencie, and yet ſhould haue nothing in him more worthie than others: for by this title he is exempt out of the order and number of all degrees both of men and Angels.</p>
               <p>Seeing theſe words then, <hi>Thou art my ſonne,</hi> are excluſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of Chriſt, it alſo followes, that ſuch honour is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming any of the Angels. If any doe yet replie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> that by this <hi>Dauid</hi> is exalted aboue the Angels: I anſwere, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> there is no inconuenience at all if hee be preferred before them, in as much as he is the figure of Chriſt: neither in that ſenſe is it any iniurie to the Angels that the high Prieſt was called the mediatour to purge ſinnes. For the Prieſts had not this as being properly theirs: but becauſe they repreſented the kingdome of Chriſt; they therefore borrowed this name of mediatour from him. Yea, and howſoeuer the Sacraments are but dead things in themſelues, yet notwithſtanding
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7791:12"/>they are adorned with thoſe titles which the Angels cannot attribute vnto themſelues without ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>Hereby then it ſufficiently appeares, that the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from this title of Sonne, is good. As touching the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or begetting of the Sonne, this wee are to note in a word, that it is taken here by way of relation. For the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is friuolous, who imagines that Chriſt is eternall <hi>to day,</hi> and ſo continues. True it is that Chriſt is the eternall ſonne of God: for hee is his wiſedome, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him before all worlds: but this makes nothing to this preſent place, which ſpeakes not of the eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sonne, but is rather ſpoken in regard of vs, who doe now acknowledge him to be the Sonne of God, ſince the Father hath manifeſted him in the fleſh. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſame declaration whereof alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Rom. 1.4. was as a kinde of eternall generation, as you would ſay: for this ſecret and hidden generation which went before, was vnknowne vnto men: and ſhould not haue come to light if the Father had not approoued the ſame by a manifeſt and viſible reuelation thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe, I will be his father, &amp;c.]</hi> In this ſecond teſtimonie, that which we haue noted ought alſo to haue place: that is, howſoeuer <hi>Salomon</hi> is here chiefly meant (who otherwiſe was leſſe than the Angels) yet notwithſtanding he is now ſeparated from the common order of all men, in that God promiſeth him that he will be his Father: for God was not reckoned his father, as being one of the ſonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or as to ſome of the Princes, but to him which was more excellent than any other. So that looke by what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge hee is eſtabliſhed Gods ſonne, by the ſame priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all others are ſhut out from hauing equall degree of honour with him. Now it appeares by the whole text, that this is no otherwiſe ſaid of <hi>Salomon,</hi> but as he was a figure of Chriſt: for the rule and gouernment of the whole world is deſtinate to this Sonne, of whom hee there ſpeakes: and a perpetuitie of gouernment is promiſed vnto him. On the contrarie, wee may ſee that <hi>Salomons</hi> kingdome was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7791:12"/>within ſtreight limits: and ſo farre was it off from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during long, that by and by after his death it was diuided; and a little after that fell to ruine. Yet in the Pſalme, the Sunne and the Moone are called foorth for witneſſes; and the Lord himſelfe ſweareth that this kingdome ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſafe and vnmoueable, as long as they ſhall ſhine in the firmament. Contrariwiſe the kingdome of <hi>Dauid</hi> fell to decay not long after, and in the end was cleane aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreouer, it may be gathered from many places of the Prophets, that this promiſe was neuer otherwiſe meant than of Chriſt. So as none can cauill, that we haue coyned a new expoſition: for this kinde of ſpeech where they call Chriſt the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> was vſually receiued among the Iewes.</p>

               <p>NOw he exalts Chriſt aboue the Angels, for another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: to wit, becauſe the Angels are commaunded to worſhip him: for thereupon it followes that he is their head and Prince. Notwithſtanding, it ſhould ſeeme that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth ill in applying this to Chriſt, which is ſpoken of God. If we anſwere that Chriſt is the eternall God, and that for this cauſe whatſoeuer appertaines to God, doth alſo by right appertaine vnto him; yet in ſo anſwering we ſhould not ſatisfie all that might be obiected. For it were to ſmall purpoſe to proue a doubtfull thing, if wee ſhould ground our argument in this matter vpon the common titles of God. For the queſtion is of Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh. But to anſwere to the point, we muſt vnderſtand, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly ſaith that the holy Ghoſt ſpake thus, when the Sonne was brought into the world: which were not truly ſpoken, if ſo be the Pſalme did not ſpeake properly of the manifeſtation of Chriſt: yet queſtionleſſe that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true meaning. For the beginning of the Pſalme is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7791:13"/>to reioyce: neither doth <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeake there to the Iewes onely, but addreſſeth his ſpeech to all the earth, euen to the Iſles: that is to ſay, to the Regions beyond the Seas. The reaſon of this reioycing is in theſe words: <hi>for the Lord reigneth.</hi> And if afterward you reade the whole Pſalm, you ſhall ſee nothing ſpoken in it that doth not belong to the kingdom of Chriſt, which began when the Goſpell was publiſhed. Yea the whole argument of the Pſalme is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a letter authenticall wherewith Chriſt is ſent (as you would ſay) to be put into the poſſeſſion of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Now what cauſe of ioy would this kingdome bring, if ſo be it were not a kingdom of ſaluation to all the world, that is to the Gentiles as well as to the Iewes? Wherefore the Apoſtle ſpeakes here very properly and to the purpoſe, when he ſaith that Chriſt is brought into the world, to wit, becauſe his comming vnto men is there deſcribed. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the Hebrue word <hi>Elohim,</hi> for which hee hath here put Angels, doth alſo ſignifie Gods: but wee are not to doubt but the Prophet ſpeakes of Angels. For this is the ſenſe, there is no power ſo high which ought not to ſtoope to the rule of this King, ſeeing his comming ſhall bring an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall ioy to all the world.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 7.

                  <hi>And of the Angels he ſaith he maketh the ſpirits his meſſengers, and his miniſters a flame of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſeemes that in alleaging this place, hee drawes it to a contrarie ſenſe. For albeit <hi>Dauid</hi> doth in this Pſalme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the order which God keepes in gouerning of the world, ſo as out of all queſtion in this fourth verſe he ſpeaks of the windes, which he ſaith are made his meſſengers, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they runne as poſts at his becke, and commandement: ſo that whenſoeuer hee cauſeth the earth to ring with his thunders, they ſhew what readie and diligent ſeruants they are to execute their charge enioyned them. But what doth all this appertaine to the Angels? For anſwere, ſome take it to be ſpoken allegorically, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7791:13"/>the literall and plaine ſenſe of Angels by an Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as they call it. But for my part, I had rather ſay that this place was alleaged to bee applied to the Angels by way of ſimilitude, in this manner: <hi>Dauid</hi> compares the windes to the Angels, ſo as they exerciſe the like office here in this world, which the Angels doe in heauen, the windes being viſible ſpirits as it were. For euen as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the creation of the world recites onely the things which are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by our ſenſes, and yet notwithſtanding would that higher things ſhould bee comprehended therewithall: ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> in this deſcription of the world, and of nature, paints out vnto vs as in a table that which we ought alſo to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as touching the heauenly order. And therefore I think this is an argument which we call a ſimilie, that is to ſay, of a thing like, when the Apoſtle transferreth that to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which is properly ſpoken of the windes.</p>

               <p>WE cannot denie but that this Pſalme was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for <hi>Salomon</hi> in forme of a mariage ſong: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his mariage with the King of Aegypts daughter is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated therein: yet notwithſtanding wee muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that that which is here ſaid is ſo excellent, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wholy be found in <hi>Salomon.</hi> Now leaſt the Iewes ſhould be conſtrained to confeſſe that Chriſt is God, they doe here frame a cauill: to wit, that this throne is of God; or that we muſt ſupplie the verbe, <hi>hath establiſhed,</hi> and ſay, <hi>God hath establiſhed thy throne.</hi> Thus after the firſt expoſition this word <hi>Elohim</hi> ſhould be tranſlated in the Genitiue, <hi>of God:</hi> the other expoſition ſuppoſeth that this ſentence ſhould be imperfect: but one may very well ſee that they ſeeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſtarting holes. Whoſoeuer then ſhall reade
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7791:14"/>this ſentence with ripenes of iudgement, and without a mind bent to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, he ſhal not denie, but the Meſſias is here called God. And let no man replie, that here is a word vſed which is common both to Angels and Iudges: for we ſhall not finde it in any place whereſoeuer, attributed to any one in particular but to God. Further, to the end that I ſtriue not about the word; where ſhal that throne be found which may be ſaid to be ſtable and firme <hi>for euer, and euer,</hi> vnleſſe it bee the throne of God? The perpetuitie therefore of the kingdome is a certaine teſtimonie of the Diuinitie. Now in the next place, the ſcepter of Chriſts kingdome is called a <hi>ſcepter of righteouſnes:</hi> whereof there was ſome figure in <hi>Salomon,</hi> but very obſcure: that is to wit, ſo farre forth as he ſhewed himſelfe a iuſt King and a louer of Equitie. But the righteouſnes, and equitie of Chriſt his kingdome doth farre exceede: the reaſon is, becauſe that by the Goſpell which is a ſpirituall ſcepter he reformeth vs according to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God. As much is to be ſaid touching his <hi>loue of righteouſnes.</hi> For becauſe he loueth it, therefore he cauſeth it to reigne in thoſe that are his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore God,</hi> euen <hi>thy God:]</hi> It is certaine that this is truly ſpoken of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who was annointed King, becauſe God preferred him before all his brethren, who excepting this, were equall, and children of a King alſo as well as he. But it more fitly agreeth to Chriſt, who hath adopted vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be companione together with him: howbeit, not by any right of our own. Now, he is <hi>anoynted aboue his felllowes,</hi> becauſe he was annointed without meaſure: but wee, euery one according to our meaſure, as it is diſtributed; to ſome more, to ſome leſſe. Moreouer, he was annoynted for our ſakes, to the end all of vs might draw out of his fulnes, Ioh. 1.16. And therfore he is the Chriſt, that is to ſay the annointed: and we Chriſtians, in, &amp; thorow him, as the riuers do ſtreame from the fountaine: now for as much as Chriſt hath receiued this annoynting in his fleſh, it is therefore ſaid that hee was annoynted of <hi>his God.</hi> For it ſhould be abſurd to ſay he was inferiour to God, vnleſſe in regard of his humane nature.</p>

               <p>IT may ſeeme at the firſt bluſh that this teſtimonie is vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleaged of Chriſt, and ſpecially in a matter ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as this is whereof he intreateth. For the queſtion is not as touching the glorie of God, but of that which properly belongs and agreeth vnto Chriſt. Now there is no mention of Chriſt in this place, but the maieſtie of God is rather ſet foorth ſimply vnto vs therein. But although it bee granted that no mention at all is made in this Pſalme of Chriſt: yet we may euidently perceiue that hee is ſo pointed out in it, that no man neede to doubt but that his kingdome is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as directly therein vnto vs, as if it were vttered in plaine and expreſſe words. Therefore whatſoeuer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it ought to be applied to the perſon of Chriſt. For whereas it is ſaid in the former verſes, Thou wilt ariſe and haue compaſſion on Sion, that the Gentiles may feare thy name, and all the Kings of the earth thy glorie. And again, when the people ſhall be gathered together, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to ſerue the Lord. All this you know was not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but in Chriſt. Truly we ſhall but loſe our labour to ſeek this God by whom all the world was vnited into one faith, and into one ſpirituall worſhip, vnleſſe wee ſeeke him in Chriſt. So then all the whole contents of this Pſalme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth properly to the perſon of Chriſt. Firſt, in that hee is called the eternall God, Creator of heauen and earth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that ſuch a perpetuitie is attributed vnto him as is without change; by reaſon whereof his Maieſtie is exalted into the higheſt degree, and himſelfe exempt out of the ranke of all creatures.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the heauens ſhall periſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:7791:15"/>ſome do reſolue the meaning thus: if it pleaſe God it ſhould ſo come to paſſe, to wit, that the heauens ſhould periſh: which ſenſe if it ſtand for good, then nothing ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. But what neede haue we of ſuch a conſtrained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when as we know that all creatures are ſubiect to vanitie: for to what purpoſe ſhould this renument of the heauens ſerue, (the which they attend and waite for with no leſſe deſire then women in trauaile to be deliuered) if there ſhould be no change of them? And therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie of Chriſt, which is heere magnified, brings ſingular conſolation to the faithfull, whereof this Pſalme in the end concludes that they ſhall bee partakers. For Chriſt, you know, communicates himſelfe, and all his benefits to his bodie the Church.</p>

               <p>HE yet againe extols the excellencie of Chriſt by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonie, to the end we might thereby knowe how farre he ſurpaſſeth the Angels. The teſtimonie is drawn out of the hundreth and tenth Pſalme; which cannot be expounded of any other than of Chriſt. For ſeeing it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for Kings to meddle with the Prieſthood, as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of king <hi>Vzzias</hi> witneſſeth; and ſeeing it is manifeſt likewiſe that neither <hi>Dauid</hi> nor any of his ſucceſſors in the kingdome were ordained Prieſts; it thereupon follows that here is a newe kingdome, and a new prieſthood, ſeeing one onely is appointed for both theſe offices. Beſides that; the eternitie of the Prieſthood agrees to none but to Chriſt. Now in the very beginning of the Pſalme he is placed at the right hand of God. Which manner of ſpeech, is as much as if he had ſaid, that the ſecond place was giuen him after the father. For it is a ſimilitude, or metaphor by which he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that he is the fathers Lieutenant and his cheif Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7791:15"/>to exerciſe his power, ſo as the Father raignes, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerns; yet by his hand. Now there is neuer a one among the angels, which hath ſo excellent and high an office: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followes that Chriſt is farre more excellent than they all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Till I make thine enemies thy footeſtoole.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt is neuer without enemies which fight againſt his kingdome, it ſeemes not altogether out of danger: eſpecially if we looke vpon thoſe who endeauour with might and maine to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, for as they haue great power and force, ſo they want no ſubtiltie, nor politique deuiſes, but haue skill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to put in exequution all their deſignes, with no leſſe then a furious madneſſe. And if on the other ſide, we ſhall with the eies of fleſn onely, looke vpon the little flocke of Chriſt, wee ſhall thinke euer and anon that his kingdome is readie to fall to the ground. But this promiſe diſpoſſeſſeth vs of all feare, to wit, when we heare that Chriſt ſhall neuer be plucked from his ſeate, but ſhall raigne rather, till he put all his enemies vnder his feete. It is profitable therefore for vs to note theſe two things. Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the kingdome of Chriſt as long as it is in this world ſhall neuer be in reſt and quiet, but ſhall haue many aduerſaries which will moleſt and trouble it: Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let the enemies plot and conſpire what they can,
<note place="margin">Though Chriſts kingdome be daily aſſaulted, yet it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.</note> yet they ſhall neuer attaine the end which they aime at: becauſe Chriſt who is ſet at the right hand of his father, is not ſet there for a time, but ſhall ſit there till the end of the world. Therefore let all thoſe looke to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and troden vnder his feete, that wil not ſubmit themſelues as ſubiects vnder his Imperiall gouernment.</p>
               <p>Now if it be demanded, whether the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall end after he hath ſubdued, and deſtroyed all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: I anſwer, it is certaine that it ſhall be perpetuall; but in ſuch a manner as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets it out vnto vs in the 15. to the Corinth. For we muſt vnderſtand that God,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15, 27.28.</note> who now will be onely knowne in Chriſt, ſhall then appeare vnto vs in himſelfe. Chriſt indeed ſhall ſtill continue the head both of men and Angels, but yet ſo, that his honour ſhall be no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7791:16"/>way diminiſhed thereby. Now they that would be further reſolued as touching this queſtion, let them haue recourſe to that which I haue written vpon the foreſaid place to the Corinthians.</p>

                  <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Now he ſpeakes of the condition of Angels, ſhewing what it is, to the ende the compariſon betweene them and Chriſt might be the better vnderſtood. True it is, that in calling them ſpirits, you may therein ſee a title of great excellencie. For in this reſpect they are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced farre aboue bodily creatures. But the word of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration which he immediately addeth is to abaſe them, and to hold them within the compaſſe of their degree: for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration is ſet againſt Rule, and Emperiall dominion. And this doth he yet further declare when he ſaith, <hi>To mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi> For the firſt Epethite, ſignifies as much, as if he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them officers: but the name of miniſter is yet more baſe and abiect. I grant indeed, it is an honourable ſeruice which God enioynes the Angels: yet notwithſtanding in as much as they ſerue; it thereby appeares that they are too inferiour to be compared with Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> who is Lord ouer all. If any ſhall obiect that Chriſt is alſo called a ſeruant and miniſter in many places, and not onely Gods ſeruant, but ours alſo: the ſolution is eaſie, to wit, that it is not in regard of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of the voluntarie abaſing of himſelfe, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, <label type="milestone">

Now the Angels on the contrarie, are created to the end they ſhould ſerue; and their whole condition conſiſts in adminiſtration. So then here is great difference betweene Chriſt and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe that which is natural in the Angels, is in Chriſt by accident, in reſpect that he is cloathed with our fleſh: and that which is theirs by neceſſitie, Chriſt accepted of it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily. Moreouer Chriſt is ſo a miniſter or ſeruant, that it derogates nothing at all from his Emperiall maieſtie, no not in the fleſh. Now the faithfull receiue from hence a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingular conſolation, when they heare that the heauenly armies are giuen them for their miniſters and ſeruants, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7791:16"/>procure their ſafetie and ſaluation. For is it not a wonderful pledge of Gods loue towards vs, to know that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly imployed for our protection? from this alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes a ſingular confirmation of our faith: to wit, that our ſaluation beeing fortified with ſuch helpes, is out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>God therefore doth prouide exceeding carefull for our weakneſſe, when he giues vs ſuch helpers which are readie with vs to reſiſt Satan, and doe euery way imploy their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and diligence to maintaine and defend vs. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is proper onely to the elect of God: and therefore if we would that Gods Angels ſhould be ours, let vs looke that we be the members of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">They that will haue the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Angels, muſt looke that themſelues be the members of Chriſt.</note> Some examples and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might be brought indeed to ſhew how the Angels haue beene ſent ſometime to attend vpon the reprobates. For in <hi>Daniel</hi> the 10. chap. and 20. verſe, mention is made of the Angels of the Perſians, and Greekes. But I anſwer, they were ſo aided by the Angels, that by meanes thereof, the Lord aduanced the ſaluation of his people. For the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie iſſues in their affaires, and the victories which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, fell out alwaies to the benefit of the Church, as to their chiefe marke and end. Howſoeuer it be, this remaines ſure, that all of vs being baniſhed by our ſinnes, out of the kingdome of God, we haue now no fellowſhip at all with the bleſſed Angels, but by the reconciliation made by Chriſt: and this is manifeſt by the ladder which the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw in a viſion erected before him.

                  </label> that in this compariſon, regard muſt be had on the one ſide to the hidden reuelation of Chriſt, and on the other ſide to that reuelation which was more manifeſt. Now for as much as Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe but darkly, and as it were vnder ſhadowes and figures in the publiſhing of the Law, wee are not to wonder (if without mentioning of Chriſt) hee ſaith the Law was giuen by Angels. For at that time hee did not ſhew himſelfe openly. But in the publiſhing of the Goſpel his glorie was ſo euidently and cleerely reuealed, that he is worthily reputed to be the author of it.</p>

By how much the more pretious they be then, ſo much the more is our vile ingratitude, if wee prize them not according to their value. Now for as much as Chriſt is great; great and rigorous will Gods vengeance be vpon all the contemners of the Goſpell. And it is to be noted, that the name of ſaluation is transferred in this place by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure Metonymia, to the doctrine: becauſe as it is Gods wil and pleaſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men ſhall be no other way ſaued than by the Goſpel;
<note place="margin">He that reiects the Goſpell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</note> ſo, in reiecting of it, we reiect the ſaluation of God.

                  <hi>Which first began to be preached by the Lord.]</hi> Here he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Sonne of God, who was the firſt preacher of the Goſpell againſt the Angels. Now withall he vſeth a preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take away a doubt which might enter into many mens phantaſies. For they had not beene taught by the mouth of Chriſt immediatly, becauſe the moſt part of them had neuer ſeene him. Had they onely reſpected men then, by whoſe miniſterie they were brought to the faith, it is likely they would not haue regarded that which they had learned of them. And therefore the Apoſtle admoniſheth them that the doctrine which was deliuered vnto them by the miniſterie of others, did not therefore ceaſe to proceede from Chriſt. For hee ſaith, that they were the diſciples of Chriſt, who faithfully reported that which they had heard and receiued of him. And therefore he vſeth this word <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, it was not a matter of report ſcattered abroad hand ouer head, as if they knew not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it came, or as if they had it by ſuſpected witneſſes: but that it hath authors both graue, and alſo men of good credit.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7791:18"/>Furthermore, wee may know by this place that this Epiſtle was not penned by S. <hi>Paul:</hi> for he vſeth not ſo to diminiſh his authoritie, as to make himſelfe one of the diſciples of the Apoſtles, not that he meant thereby to purchaſe any glorie to his owne perſon: but becauſe falſe teachers vnder this colour endeuoured ſo much the more to leſſen the credit of his doctrine. It appeares then that it is not S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> ſeeing the author writes that hee had the Goſpell by the report of others, and not by reuelation.</p>

Now for the better amplification hereof he vſeth three words to note out miracles. They are called <hi>Powers,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe that in them the Lord ſheweth a ſpeciall and extraordinarie teſtimonie of his vertue and power. They are called <hi>Signes,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe they awaken mens mindes to looke a little higher than to that which appeares. They are called <hi>Miracles,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe they containe ſomewhat that is new and ſtrange. In this word <hi>witneſſing,</hi> is noted the right vſe of miracles: to wit, they ſerue to eſtabliſh and confirme the Goſpell: for we finde that almoſt all miracles whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they were wrought, ſerued as ſeales to the word of God. And therefore ſo much the more ought the ſuperſtition of the Papiſts to be condemned, which alleage the miracles of their owne deuiſing; for they make them ſerue (not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) but to corrupt the truth of God.</p>
               <p>This word, <hi>thereto,</hi> hath this ſenſe, that wee are confirmed in the faith of the Goſpell by an agreement and harmonie which is betweene God and men, becauſe the miracles wrought by God doe agree with the voyce of men, and ſerue as a teſtimonie thereto. Afterwards he addeth, <hi>Gifts of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> by which the doctrine of the Goſpell was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7791:19"/>adorned, as being dependances of it.

For otherwiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the firſt to the Cor. 14.22. that the diuerſities of tongues are giuen for ſignes, not to them that beleeue, but to them that beleeue not.

And that is it which we had in the beginning of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, where it is ſaid that Chriſt is ordained of his Father <hi>heire</hi> of all things. Truly in that he attributes the inheritance to one onely, hee thereby excludes all others as ſtrangers. And that very iuſtly: for wee are all of vs baniſhed out of Gods kingdome. What haue we to doe then to ſcrape vnto our ſelues thoſe creatures which hee hath ordained for the nouriſhment of his houſehold children and ſeruants? But Chriſt, by whom wee are called againe into the familie and houſehold of God, receiueth vs with him into the ſocietie of his right and title, to the end that by him (with all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) wee might enioy the whole world with the bleſſing of God.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7791:21"/>Chriſt in regard he was made none account of: reſtraining the glorie to the day of the reſurrection: whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> ſtretcheth it generally to the whole life of man. I anſwere, that it was not the Apoſtles meaning to recite the natiue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the words. For no inconuenience followes, if we ſay that he alludes to the words of <hi>Dauid,</hi> thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the point which he handleth: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the tenth to the Romanes alleageth the place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Who ſhall aſcend into heauen? He addeth by and by after, not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, but rather an amplification to adorne his ſpeech, transferring that to the heauenly heritage, and to hell, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid of the Heauens, and of the Sea. And ſuch is the intention of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Lord (ſaith he) thou haſt aduanced man to ſuch great dignitie, that hee wants not much of approching neere to the honour of God, or of the Angels. For thou haſt made him ruler ouer the whole world. The Apoſtle ment not to ouerthrow this ſenſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet to turne it to a contrarie: but his meaning is onely that we ſhould behold in Chriſt that abaſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which he did vndergo for a little time: and afterward that glorie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he was crowned for euer: which he doth, rather by way of alluſion to the words, than to expreſſe that which <hi>Dauid</hi> ment by them. He taketh <hi>to be mindfull and to viſite,</hi> for one thing; ſauing that to <hi>viſite</hi> hath a more full ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

But all things are not made ſubiect to mankinde: therefore hee ſpeakes not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular man. But this argument would not hold: becauſe the ſecond propoſition, which wee call the minor, doth alſo agree vnto Chriſt. For euen to him all things are not yet ſubiect: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes 1. Cor. 15.18. Therefore the words following haue another ſenſe. For after hee hath made Chriſt to bee the ruler ouer all creatures without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, he addeth by way of a contrarie obiection, <hi>But we ſee not yet all things ſubiect vnto him:</hi> and to ſatisfie vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

               <p>But in the firſt place, ſome are offended that the Apoſtle doth ouer nicely gather that all things ſhould not as yet be ſubiect vnto Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> meant to comprehend al things generally. For the kindes of creatures which hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reckoneth vp, ſhewes nothing of all this: to wit, the beaſts of the field, the fiſhes of the ſea, and the birds of the ayre. I anſwere, that one generall ſentence is not to bee reſtrained to theſe kindes, becauſe <hi>Dauids</hi> meaning was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew ſome examples of this lordſhip in thoſe things which doe moſt ordinarily preſent themſelues before our eyes: or rather to the leaſt things, that wee might know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ours but by the bountie of God, and by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Chriſt.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7791:22"/>he addes that it is done <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> becauſe the cauſe of our redemption was the infinite loue of God, which cauſed him not to ſpare his onely begotten ſonne, Rom. 8.32.

               <p>THe point whereunto the Apoſtle aimeth, is to make the abiection of Chriſt glorious in the eyes of the faithfull. For when he ſaith that he clothed himſelfe with our fleſh, it ſeemes he meant to ſet Chriſt among the common order of men. And then the croſſe being added, it abaſeth him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all ſorts of men.
<note place="margin">Chriſt must not be the leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly abaſed himſelfe for our ſakes.</note> Wherefore good heede muſt be taken that Chriſt bee not the leſſe eſteemed, becauſe that of his owne good will he made himſelfe of none account for our ſakes. And this is the point which is now handled in this text. For the Apoſtle ſhewes that euen for this cauſe the Sonne of God ought to be honourably eſteemed; in regard he was thus conſecrated to bee the Prince of our ſaluation. Firſt of all he takes it for granted, that Gods ordaining of it ought to bee reſted in, becauſe that as all things are ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his power, ſo ought they alſo to ſerue to his glorie. Wherefore wee ought to ſeeke no better cauſe than this; It ſo pleaſed God. Hereunto appertaines that circumlocution
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7791:23"/>of words which hee vſeth: <hi>By whom, and for whom are all things:</hi> hee might in one word haue named God; but his meaning was to ſhew that wee muſt hold and eſteeme that to be chiefly good, which God hath ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whoſe will and glory is the very right end of all things. Yet notwithſtanding it ſeemes that which hee would ſay is not yet fully prooued, to wit, that it was conuenient that Chriſt ſhould be conſecrated after this manner. But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon the ordinarie courſe which God is wont to hold in his dealing with thoſe that are his. For his will is they ſhould be exerciſed with diuers miſeries, and that their whole life ſhould bee a continuall croſſe. It was neceſſarie then that Chriſt, as hee was the firſt borne, ſhould be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the croſſe, thereby entring into his principalitie; becauſe it is the rule and common condition of all. This is the conformitie of the head with the members, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> entreateth, Rom. 8.29.</p>
               <p>Now it is a ſingular conſolation to aſſwage and ſweeten the bitternes of the croſſe, when the faithfull doe heare that they are ſanctified vnto glorie together with Chriſt by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and tribulations: and that in very deed they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue there is good cauſe why they ſhould embrace the croſſe amiably, rather than fearefully. Which cannot bee brought to paſſe, vnleſſe this ſhame of the croſſe bee by and by ſwallowed vp, and the glorie that thereby comes vnto them doth alſo ſhine forth. For who will deſpiſe that which is ſacred; yea that which euen God himſelfe hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Who will eſteeme that to bee reprochfull wherewith we are prepared vnto glorie? Now both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is here affirmed of the death of Chriſt. <hi>By whom are all things.</hi> When it is ſpoken of the creation, this is attributed to the Son as a thing which is proper vnto him, to wit, that all things were created by him: but the Apoſtle ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els in this place, but that all creatures are ſteadie and vpholden in their eſtate by the power of God. Whereas we haue turned the word, <hi>to conſecrate,</hi> others haue put, <hi>to make.</hi> But for as much as the Greeke word which the Apoſtle v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7791:23"/>hath diuers ſignifications, I thinke it is very cleere, that mine expoſition agrees beſt to the ſcope of the text. For he notes here a ſolemne and lawfull conſecration, by which the children of God are brought in to obtaine their degree, yea euen to bee ſeparated from the reſt of the world: and mention alſo is by and by after made, of ſanctification.</p>

And in the meane while hee ſhewes that it is a ſingular teſtimonie of Gods goodnes that Chriſt hath taken our fleſh. He ſaith then that the author of holines, and wee which are partakers of the ſame <hi>are all of one;</hi> that is to ſay, of one nature, as I for mine owne part doe interpret it. It is commonly vnderſtood of <hi>Adam.</hi> Some doe referre it to God; but altogether without reaſon. For I thinke it rather to be meant of one nature: as if he ſhould ſay, made and framed of one lumpe. Now this ſerues greatly to augment our confidence and aſſurance; to wit, that we are ioyned to the Sonne of God by ſo ſtreight a bond, that wee may finde the very ſame holines in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereof we ſtand in neede. For he doth not onely ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie vs as he is God, but the proprietie to ſanctifie is alſo in his humane nature: not that the humanitie hath this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it ſelfe, but becauſe God hath ſhed into it a perfect fulnes of holines, to the end we ſhould all draw our holines from thence.

                  <hi>For which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.]</hi> This place here alleaged is taken out of the two and twenty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7791:24"/>Pſalme. Now that Chriſt is there brought in ſpeaking, or <hi>Dauid</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt, wee haue firſt of all the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts for witneſſes, who doe alleage many verſes of this Pſalme: as namely theſe, They parted my garments among them: They gaue me gall for my drinke: Alſo, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Afterwards euen the thing it ſelfe ſheweth it. For in the hiſtorie of the paſſion, we may ſee a liuely image of all things there mentioned. And the concluſion of the Pſalme, which is the vocation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, cannot be referred to any other than to Chriſt. All the ends of the earth ſhall turne vnto God, and all the families of the Gentiles ſhall bow before him: The kingdome is the Lords, and he ſhall rule ouer the Gentiles. The truth of all theſe things is only in Chriſt, who did not enlarge Gods kingdome in little or narrow places, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, but hath ſpread it through the world, whereas it was before ſhut vp within certaine bounds and limits. Wherefore this place here alleaged is alſo queſtionleſſe ſpoken of him, which he doth very fitly; and vſeth a moſt ſignificant word when he ſaith, <hi>he is not aſhamed.</hi> For how great is the difference which is betweene him and vs? Surely hee humbled himſelfe very low, when hee vouchſafed to call vs his brethren: who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had bin vtterly vnworthie to be eſteemed ſo much as his vaſſals. The circumſtance alſo doth greatly amplifie this wonderfull fauour of his towards vs. For Chriſt ſpeakes in that place,
<note place="margin">It is no ſmall honour that Chriſt doth vs, in calling vs his brethren.</note> not as a mortall man in the ſhape of a ſeruant, but as being clothed with immortall glorie after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Wherefore this title is no leſſe excellent, than if hee had carried vs vp into heauen with him. As oft therefore as we heare that Chriſt calles vs <hi>brethren,</hi> let vs remember hee doth after a ſort clothe vs with this qualitie, that with the name of <hi>brethren</hi> we might alſo apprehend the bleſſed life, with all the heauenly benefits contained therein.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is to be noted what office Chriſt takes vpon him, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Chriſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Gospell.</note> that Chriſt is the author of the Goſpell, howſoeuer it is offered vnto vs onely by men. And that is it which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2. Cor. 5.20. that hee, and the reſt of the Miniſters are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt: when they doe beſeech vs in the ſtead of Chriſt to be reconciled to God. Which ought to affect vs with great reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Goſpell. For truly we are not to thinke that they are men which ſpeake, but Chriſt rather by their mouth. For euen then when hee promiſed to preach the name of God vnto men, hee ceaſed to conuerſe with them in the world, and yet queſtionleſſe he attributes not this office vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for nothing. He hath therefore fully accompliſhed it by his Apoſtles and Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the midſt of the congregation.]</hi> It yet appeares more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly by this, that the publiſhing of the praiſes of God, is alwaies contained in the Goſpell. For as ſoone as it is giuen vs of God to know him; infinite are his praiſes which doe ſound in our hearts and eares. Let vs alſo note herewithall that Chriſt by his example doth exhort vs to ſing theſe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes publikely, in ſuch wiſe as they may bee heard of many. For it is not ſufficient that euery one of vs apart ſhould giue thankes for the benefits wee haue receiued of God, vnleſſe by teſtifying the ſame our thankfulnes openly, we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mutually ſtirre vp one another to doe the like. And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this doctrine is as a ſharpe goad in our ſides to pricke vs forward to praiſe God with a more ardent affection of heart, ſeeing we heare that Chriſt ſingeth firſt, and doth as it were giue vs the tune to make vs ſing after him.</p>

For beſides that verſe which S. <hi>Paul</hi> alleageth, Rom. 15.9. applying it to the kingdom of Chriſt, touching the vocation of the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.50.</note> the order of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thereof ſufficiently ſhewes that <hi>Dauid</hi> there ſpeaks vnder the perſon of another. For wee ſhall ſcarſely ſee the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7791:25"/>leaſt ſhadow of that great and excellent maieſtie in <hi>Dauid,</hi> which is there ſet foorth with moſt magnificent termes. He boaſts himſelfe to haue been placed the head ouer the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and that euen ſtrangers, and ſuch as knew him not ſhould of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſubmit their necks vnder him at the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearing of his renowme. Now <hi>Dauid</hi> indeed with force of armes conquered ſome people which were neighbors &amp; very well knowne, and made them tributaries vnto him: but what is this in regard of the conqueſts of many other Kings beſides? Moreouer, where is that voluntarie ſubiection? where are the people ſo farre off, that hee ſhould not know them? In a word, where is that ſolemne publiſhing of the grace of God among the Gentiles, whereof the concluſion of the Pſalme makes mention? It is Chriſt then vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who is ordained to be the head ouer diuers nations, to whom ſtrangers ſhould ſubmit themſelues euen from the ends of the earth, and that onely by being moued with the report of him, that is to ſay, being touched with the hearing of the word. For they are not conſtrained to receiue his yoke by force of armes, but being ſubiected by force of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they willingly offer themſelues to obey him. We do alſo ſee in the Church that ſame fained and diſſembling profeſſion, whereof the Pſalme ſpeaketh. For many in all times doe profeſſe themſelues to bee of Chriſt; but it is not from the heart. Let vs hold this then as a thing certaine, that the text of this Pſalme which the Apoſtle alleageth is fitly and properly expounded of Chriſt. But what is all this to the preſent purpoſe? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> For although Chriſt doe truſt in God, it ſeemes it ſhould not therefore follow that wee and Chriſt are one. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwere, the argument is good: for if ſo be hee had not been a man ſubiect to humane neceſſities, he ſhould haue had no neede of ſuch truſt. Seeing therefore that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe depends vpon the helpe of God, he hath the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with vs. Truly it is not in vaine or for nothing that wee are ſo commaunded to truſt in God: for without faith we are vtterly miſerable, and poore wretched creatures. The truſt then which we put in God, is a teſtifying of our pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7791:25"/>and want. Howbeit in one point we differ from Chriſt: that is to ſay, hee did voluntarily ſubmit himſelfe to thoſe infirmities; which are impoſed vpon vs by neceſſitie. Yet this ought greatly to imbolden vs to truſt in God, becauſe we haue Chriſt for our Captaine and Maſter. For who ſhall feare to goe aſtray following his ſteps? We neede not feare, I ſay, that our faith which wee haue in common with Chriſt ſhould be in vaine, ſeeing we know it cannot be deceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold here am I and the children &amp;c.]</hi> It is very certaine that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in this eight chapter ſpeakes of himſelfe. For howſoeuer it be true that he giues the people hope of their deliuerance, and that the promiſe which hee publiſhed was not receiued as a thing of any certaintie: yet to the end the infidelitie and obſtinacy of the people ſhould be no diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto him, the Lord commaunds him to ſeale vp that doctrine which he had taught, among a very few of the faithfull. And it is as much as if hee had ſaid, the doctrine which thou haſt deliuered is reiected of the greater part, yet there are ſome notwithſtanding (although a little handfull indeede) which will receiue it. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſtaying himſelfe vpon this anſwere, takes courage againe vnto him, and proteſteth that he and the diſciples which God hath giuen him, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies readie to follow God. Now it remaines to ſhew how the Apoſtle applies this ſentence to Chriſt. Firſt of all, there is no man of ſound iudgement which will denie, but that which is there ſpoken as touching the Lord, who ſhould be a ſtone of offence to the kingdome of Iudah and Iſrael, was fulfilled in Chriſt. And in very trueth, like as the returne and deliuerance out of the captiuitie of Babylon, was as a beginning and figure of that principall deliuerance which was atchieued vnto vs and to the fathers by the outſtretched arme of Chriſt: ſo alſo there were then ſo few euen among the Iewes which enioyed this benefit of God; that onely a ſmall remnant were ſaued. Now that was a foretelling as it were and a ſigne of their blinding which was to enſue: by which it is now come to paſſe that in reiecting of Chriſt, they haue therewithal reiected God alſo, and haue worthily
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7791:26"/>periſhed. For we muſt note that the promiſes as touching the reſtauration of the Church, whereof the Prophets make mention; began when the Iewes were brought out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, and doth alſo reach euen to the kingdome of Chriſt. As alſo the Lord himſelfe in bringing backe the people from thence, had this end, that the Church ſhould continue euen to the comming of his ſonne, by whome at the laſt it was truely and firmely eſtabliſhed. Seeing it is ſo, God ſpeakes not onely to <hi>Iſai,</hi> when he commands him to ſeale vp the law and the teſtimonie: but in his perſon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands the ſame to all the Miniſters of his word, who ſhould fight againſt the incredulitie of the people: and therefore it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belongs to Chriſt, who ſhould be aſſayled of the Iewes with a more obſtinate and furious rebellion, than all the Prophets were which were before him. Nay doe we not ſee that thoſe who haue ſucceeded Iſrael, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the name of Chriſtians, haue not onely reiected his Goſpel, but doe alſo furiouſly ſet themſelues againſt him? But howſoeuer the doctrine of the goſpel be eſteemed a ſtone of offence to thoſe that are in the boſome of the Church, yet God will not haue it fall to ruine for all that; but will rather command it to be ſealed vp among his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And Chriſt in the name of all the Doctors, as their head, or rather as the onely Doctor who guides vs by their miniſtry, pronounceth that although we ſee ſuch a deſperate vnthankfulneſſe in the world, yet there ſhall alwaies be ſome which ſhall yield themſelues obedient vnto God. Thus you ſee how this place of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is fitly applied vnto Chriſt. And thereupon the Apoſtle gathers that we are one with him, becauſe he aſſociates vs with himſelfe, when he offers himſelfe, and vs together with him, to his father. For they who obey God vnder one and the ſame rule of faith, make alſo one ſelfe ſame bodie. Could any thing be ſaid more properly for the praiſe of faith, than when we are made companions with the ſonne of God, who exhorts vs by his example, and ſhewes vs the way? Wherefore if we followe the word of God, we knowe aſſuredly that we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7791:26"/>haue Chriſt for our guid: contrariwiſe thoſe who turne from the obedience of the word, doe nothing at all belong to Chriſt. Is there any thing, I pray you, more deſirable than this: to wit, that we conſent with the Sonne of God? Now this conſent and agreement conſiſts in faith: it follows therefore, that by infidelitie we diſſent from Chriſt, which is the moſt deteſtable thing that can be. This word <hi>children,</hi> which in many places of the ſcriptures ſignifies as much as ſeruants, is taken here for Diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which God hath giuen me:]</hi> In theſe words is noted out vnto vs the firſt cauſe of obedience, to wit, that God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted vs to himſelfe. Chriſt brings none to the father but thoſe whome he hath giuen him. Now we know that this donation depends vpon the Eternal Election: becauſe thoſe whome the father hath ordained vnto life, thoſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the tuition of his ſonne, to the end he may conſerue and keepe them. And that is it which he ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the father hath giuen me, ſhall come vnto me.</hi> Therefore when we feele that we can ſubmit our ſelues vnto God in obedience of faith, let vs learne to attribute it wholly vnto his mercie, becauſe we would neuer otherwiſe haue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted our ſelues to be brought to him by the hand of Chriſt. Moreouer this doctrine doth furniſh vs with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar matter of Confidence; for who would tremble vnder the protection and ſafegard of Chriſt? who is he that hauing ſuch a keeper would not boldly deſpiſe all danger? And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Behold me, and my children,</hi> he fulfils that indeed, which he elſewhere promiſeth, That he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any of thoſe whome he hath receiued of his father to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.28. Laſtly, let vs note from hence, that although the world doe furiouſly reiect the Goſpel, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſheepe of Chriſt will alwaies acknowledge the voyce of their ſhepheard. Wherefore let vs not be diſmaied, though almoſt all people and nations of the world doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it; ſeeing Chriſt will gather thoſe that are giuen into his cuſtodie. If the Reprobate plunge themſelues into death by their impietie, the plants which God hath not planted are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7791:27"/>thereby plucked vp, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.13. In the meane while let vs not doubt but that he knowes his own, and that the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of them all is ſealed vp in him, to the ende none ſhould eſcape him. <hi>The foundation of God remaines ſure, and hath his ſeale, The Lord knowes who are his.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.

This place is worthy to be wel obſerued: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not onely confirmes the truth of Chriſt his humane nature, but alſo ſhewes what fruit comes vnto vs thereby. <hi>The ſonne of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was made man; to the ende he might participate the ſame nature and condition with vs.</hi> Could he ſay any thing more to the purpoſe for the confirmation of our faith? for by this it appeares that he loues vs with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable loue. The fulneſſe of which loue conſiſts in this, that he tooke vpon him our nature; that he might thereby ſubiect himſelfe to the condition of death, for as he was God he could not die. Now howſoeuer he toucheth the fruit of his death but in fewe words, yet notwithſtanding in theſe few he doth expreſſe the matter, with wonderfull life and efficacie: how? he hath ſo kept vs from the tyrannie of the diuell, that we are out of his danger: and hath ſo redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs from death, that we need not now feare it any more. But becauſe there is no word which hath not his weight, let
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7791:27"/>vs yet a litle more diligently examine them. Firſt this <hi>destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the deuill,</hi> whereof he ſpeakes, ſhewes, that he hath now no more power ouer vs. For howſoeuer the deuill hath force and power ſtill,
<note place="margin">The Diuels power weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and deuiſeth daily to worke our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet notwithſtanding the power which he hath to hurt vs is weakened, or at the leaſt limited. And doubtleſſe it is a great conſolation, to be aſſured that we haue to doe with ſuch an enemie as hath no power ouer vs. Now that this is ſaid in regard of vs; we may gather by the member following, <hi>which had the power of death,</hi> for the Apoſtle would hereby giue vs to vnderſtand, that the deuill is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, in as much as he raigned to our deſtruction. For this power is ſo called becauſe of the effect; for it is deadly to vs, and brings forth deſtruction. He ſhewes then that not onely the tyrranie of Satan is deſtroyed by the death of Chriſt, but alſo that Satan himſelfe hath receiued ſuch a wound, that we need now no more to feare him, then if he were not at all. He ſpeakes of the <hi>Deuill</hi> in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, according to the cuſtome of the Scriptures: not that we ſhould imagine there is no more but one, but becauſe all of them together make one body, which cannot be as we know, without an head.</p>

For from whence comes death but from the wrath of God inkindled againſt ſinne? thence comes this bondage all our life long: that is to ſay, that anguiſh and continuall diſquietnes wherein poore ſoules are impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the iudgement of God doth alwaies preſent it ſelf before our eyes by the knowledge and guilt of ſinne: now Chriſt by bearing our curſe vpon him hath freed vs from this feare, when he tooke away whatſoeuer was fearefull in death.

Now in that hee hath preferred vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angels, was it for any excellencie that was in vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them? No in no wiſe, but onely in regard of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Wherefore there is no cauſe why we ſhould glorie as if we were more excellent than the Angels, vnleſſe it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heauenly Father hath ſhewed more mercie to vs than he hath done to them: the which wee haue good cauſe to confeſſe, to the end the Angels with admiration may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from aboue ſo great bountie powred foorth vpon the

Whereas he ſaith in the preſent tence, <hi>he takes not,</hi> or <hi>tooke not,</hi> I referre it to the teſtimonie of the Scriptures, as if it did repreſent that before our eyes which had been before witneſſed by the Prophets. Moreouer, this onely place ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to ouerthrow <hi>Marcion,</hi> the <hi>Maniches,</hi> and all ſuch railers, who denie Chriſt to be true man, begotten of mans ſeede. For if he onely bare the figure of a man; he often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo in old time vnder the forme of an Angell, and then where was the difference? But becauſe it cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that euen Chriſt was indeede a very Angell clothed with their nature: therefore it is rather ſaid that hee tooke the nature of man, than of the Angels. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeakes of this <hi>nature,</hi> and ſhewes that Chriſt hauing taken fleſh, was true man, ſo as now in two natures there is the vnitie of the perſon. For this place doth nothing at all fauour <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who forged two Chriſts, as if the Sonne of God had not been true man, but had onely dwelt in the fleſh of man.

For hee meant to ſhew that wee haue a brother in the perſon of God, becauſe of the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one ſelfe ſame nature with vs. Wherefore not contenting himſelfe to call him man, he ſaith he was begotten of the <hi>ſeed of man.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly names <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> to get the more credit to that which he ſaith, becauſe it is taken out of the Scripture.</p>

                  </q> Not that the Sonne of God had any neede to be inſtructed, or framed to a mercifull affection by hauing experience of our troubles and afflictions: but becauſe wee could not be perſwaded of his gentle and inclinable affection to helpe vs, vnleſſe he had been exerciſed with our miſeries. For this, as all the reſt was done in regard of vs. As often then as we are preſſed with any kinde of calamitie whatſoeuer, let vs remember that nothing befalles vs whereof the Sonne of God hath not experience in himſelfe, that hee might haue compaſſion vpon vs: and let vs not doubt but that he will aſſiſt vs euen as if hee himſelfe ſuffered with vs. This word <hi>faithfull,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Faithfull.</note> ſignifies truth and vprightnes.

For when he called him heretofore the Doctor, and ſoueraigne high Prieſt; in thoſe few words he made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene him, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> now he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both the members.
<note place="margin">Two offices of Chriſt.</note> For hee adornes him with two titles, becauſe he alſo hath two offices, and preheminences in the Church of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> performed the office of a Prophet and Teacher; <hi>Aaron</hi> the office of the high Prieſt: but both eſtates were giuen to Chriſt. Wherefore if we will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7791:30"/>receiue him as we ought, we muſt conſider what he is: we muſt I ſay, cloath him with his vertue and power, leaſt in ſtead of him we take ſome vaine ſhadow and imagination of Chriſt. Firſt of all, this word <hi>Conſider,</hi> hath his weight: for it ſignifies that diligent attention is to be giuen to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it cannot be contemned without a fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment enſuing: and then that the true knowledge of Chriſt ſufficeth to chaſe away, yea to cauſe all darknes and errors to vaniſh Now to the end he might quicken them vp to a more earneſt affection and ſtudie; he admoniſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their own <hi>vocation;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, God hath not done you a ſmall fauour in calling you to his kingdome. It remaines then that you fixe your eies vpon Chriſt,
<note place="margin">The only way to ſecure the calling of the faithfull, is to ſhroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the wings of Chriſt.</note> as vpon your leader and guide in the way. For the calling of the faithfull can no other way be ſecured, vnleſſe they wholly gather themſelues vnder Chriſt. And therefore let vs not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that this is ſaid onely to the Iewes, but that it is a generall doctrine propounded to all thoſe who deſire to come to the kingdome of God. Let ſuch looke diligently to Ieſus, becauſe he is the onely maſter of our faith, &amp; hath confirmed it by his ſacrifice. For <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is here taken for faith.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>2</label> This is a Commendation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip of Chriſt; to the ende that the faithfull might reſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſecurely in him. Now he commends it two waies: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt becauſe the heauenly father hath ordained him for our teacher: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, in that Chriſt for his part hath faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the office enioyned him of his father. Theſe two things are alwaies neceſſarie to get authoritie to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<note place="margin">A lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> For God only ought to be heard, as the whole ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doth teſtifie. For this cauſe Chriſt proteſteth, that the doctrine which he brings is not his, but his fathers: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.16. And in another place he ſaith, <hi>he that receiueth me, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him that ſent me. Luk.</hi> 9.48. For we ſpeake of Chriſt, who as he is cloathed with our fleſh, is the miniſter and ſeruant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7791:30"/>of God, to declare thoſe things vnto vs which are giuen him in charge. Now as the calling of Chriſt is of God,
<note place="margin">Faithfulneſſe in performing the worke of this calling.</note> ſo beſides that, he doth alſo carrie himſelfe faithfully and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in the ſame; which is a thing requiſite in all true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to the end they may haue audience and authoritie in the Church. Now if both are to be found in Chriſt, then aſſuredly we cannot deſpiſe them, but God in all of them muſt of neceſſitie be deſpiſed. <hi>As Moſes was.</hi> Leauing a little his ſpeech of the Prieſthood, he comes now to deale with the Apoſtleſhippe. For although the coueuant of God containes two parts: to wit, the ſetting forth of the doctrine, and the reall confirmation thereof, if we may ſo ſpeake: the exact perfection of the Couenant ſhould not otherwiſe be fulfilled of Chriſt, vnleſſe both of them doe appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The Author of this Epiſtle then hauing made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one, and the other, he hath alſo at the laſt by a briefe exhortation quickened vp the faithfull to attention. But he entreth now into a more large treatiſe, and fuller handling of theſe things, and beginneth at the charge and office of the Doctour: therefore alſo he compares him with <hi>Moſes</hi> onely. Whereas he ſaith <hi>in all his houſe,</hi> it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>Moſes:</hi> but I had rather referre it to Chriſt, to the end he may be ſaid to be faithfull to his father in the whole gouernment of his houſe. From whence it followes that none are to be accounted of the Church of God, but thoſe who acknowledge Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this man is counted worthy, &amp;c.]</hi> Leaſt he might be thought to make <hi>Moſes</hi> equall with Chriſt, he ſhewes how he is much more excellent then <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he prooues by two arguments, for <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo appointed ouer the Church, that himſelfe was alwaies a part and member ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But Chriſt beeing the maſter builder, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was farre aboue the building. <hi>Moſes</hi> in gouerning of others, was alſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned himſelfe, becauſe he was but a ſeruant: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the ſonne obtained the principalitie. It is an vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all metaphor both common and familiar in the ſcripture, to call the Church the houſe of God, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7791:31"/>it is compoſed and built of the faithfull, therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them is called a liuing ſtone. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo veſſels and inſtruments by which the houſe is decked and garniſhed. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. There is not any one which is ſo abſolute ouer others, that himſelfe in the meane while ſhould not be a member and comprehended vnder the bodie.

Euen ſo now doth the author of this Epiſtle, exhort the faithfull Iewes, who had made profeſſion of Chriſt, to perſeuere in the faith; to the end they might haue place in the houſhold of God. He had ſaid before that the houſe of God was vnder the rule of Chriſt: and now he addes this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to very good purpoſe, telling them that they ſhal haue a place in this houſe of God, if ſo be they obey Chriſt. But in regard they had before begunne to receiue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he ioynes this condition, <hi>if they holdfaſt that confidence, and that reioycing,</hi>

To which, as all the doctrine of the Papiſts is contrarie, ſo if they had none other falſe doctrine but this alone; it would rather deſtroy the Church of God, then build it vp. For they not onely darken the truth, by their inuentions, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly condemne this confidence, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeakes, of preſumption.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7791:32"/>And beſides, what aſſurednes of confidence and boldnes could wee haue thereof, when men know not what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?

Now becauſe theſe two reaſons had place at that time when the Apoſtle liued, he doth therefore willingly fit that to the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which had been long agoe ſpoken by <hi>Dauid;</hi> to the end they alſo to whom hee addreſſeth his ſpeech might not bee giuen too much to the following of their fathers ſteps. From hence we may gather a generall doctrine, to wit, how farre we ought to follow our fathers: that is to ſay, euen ſo farre foorth as their authoritie doth not turne vs from the onely one God. For if euer any fathers were worthie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Iewes doubtleſſe obtained the firſt place among others.
<note place="margin">How farre the example of our forefathers is to be followed,</note> And yet notwithſtanding <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth expreſſe charge to their children, to take heede how they grew like them. And for mine owne part I make no doubt but he hath regard here to that which is written in the 17. of Exodus. For <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here vſe two words, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewes were giuen to the place, becauſe of that which happened: to wit, <hi>Meriba,</hi> which ſignifies contention or ſtrife: and <hi>Maſſah,</hi> which ſignifies tentation: for they tempred God,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7791:34"/>ſaying, that he was not in the middeſt of them, becauſe they lacked water, Exod. 17.7. and alſo ſtrife, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now although they had ſhewed many examples of their incredulitie, <hi>Dauid</hi> notwithſtanding chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this principally, becauſe it was the moſt memorable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others: as alſo becauſe that according to the order of time it followed all the reſt of the temptations, at leaſtwiſe for the greater part, as wee may ſee by the fourth booke of <hi>Moſes</hi> called Numbers, where there is a continual ſucceſſion of many temptations from the 11. chapter to the 20. Now this is written in the twentieth; which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances make the offence much more hainous. For what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is it that hauing had experience of the power of God, they ſhould yet continue to contend and ſtriue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapertly with him, and ſhould giue no credit to him at all? He hath then put one kinde for all. This word to <hi>tempt,</hi> is taken in the ill part, as we vſe to ſay, to diſtruſt with deſpite. For although God had many times ſuccoured them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding forgetting all he had done for them, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in ſcorne where his vertue and power was become?</p>

And by this means he ſhewes that they had well deſerued to be ſo rigorouſly dealt withall by him, becauſe they ceaſed not to augment his wrath more and more by their tranſgreſſions: as if he ſhould ſay, this is the generation to whom I haue denied the inioying of the land which I had promiſed them; who for fortie full yeares together haue ſhewed themſelues ſtill to be fooliſhly obſtinate by innumerable offences.</p>

Now the ſumme of all theſe wordes is, that whereas God threatened in the Pſalme, to depriue them of his reſt, the ſame threatning alſo appertaines vnto vs: for at this day we are called by the Goſpel to a certaine kind of reſt. The chiefeſt difficultie of this place is from hence, that many haue offered violence vnto it, to drawe it to another ſenſe: for the Apoſtle hath none other meaning, but by ſetting of a certaine reſt before vs, to ſpurre vs on forward to the deſire of it; as alſo to pricke vs on with feare, that we be not turned aſide from inioying of it through infidelitie.

Infidelitie onely is it that hindreth vs to enter: it followes then that by faith we doe enter thereinto. For wee muſt call to minde what hath been ſaid alreadie, to wit, that God being angrie with the vnbeleeuers, ſwaie that they ſhould not enter into his reſt. Thoſe then enter into it, who are not hindred by infidelitie: prouided that God doe call them. But by ſpeaking in the firſt perſon, hee drawes them after a more ſweete way or meanes; ſeparating them out of the number of ſtrangers. <hi>Although the workes were finiſhed from the foundation of the world.</hi> To make a definition what our reſt is, hee ſends vs to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is to wit, that God reſted from all his workes by and by after the creation of the world: and laſtly hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that the true reſt of the faithfull which ſhall endure for euer, is, when they are conformed vnto God.

                  <hi>It remaineth that ſome must enter into it:</hi> for if it be a puniſhment (as hath been alreadie ſaid) of infidelitie not to enter: the entrance then is open to the beleeuers.

Now it ſeemes that <hi>Dauids</hi> words haue no ſuch meaning.

I anſwere, that the conſequence is good: to wit, that the ſame which was taken away from them, is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs: ſeeing the holy Ghoſt admoniſheth vs to take heede that by our owne fault we be not puniſhed as they were. Therefore the Apoſtle rightly ſaith, that the promiſe

Certainly they had a higher reſpect than vnto that land: for whereas the land of Canaan was ſo highly eſteemed,
<note place="margin">VVhy the Iewes deſired ſo much to enter into the land of Canaan.</note> the faithfull did it for no other cauſe, but in regard it was vnto them an image and pledge of the ſpirituall inheritance. So then, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had obtained the poſſeſſion of it, they were not to reſt in the view thereof, as though they had been come to the fulnes of their deſires, but were rather to meditate of the ſpirituall meaning thereof. Thoſe of whom <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake in the Pſalme, enioyed the poſſeſſion: but yet in the meane while they were admoniſhed to ſeeke a better reſt elſwhere. Wee ſee that the land of Canaan was a reſt but onely in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and figure, in ſuch wiſe as it was needfull for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to looke further.</p>
               <p>In this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſaith that reſt was not giuen them by <hi>Ioſhua:</hi> becauſe the people entred into the land vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his conduct, to the end they might with the more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and readie affection aſpire vnto heauen. And by this it is eaſie to gather what difference there is betweene them and vs. For although they and we haue one end ſet before vs vnto which we ought to aime: yet they had more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall figures, by which they were holpen: which figures we haue not,
<note place="margin">VVe haue no ſuch neede of ſhadowes and ſigures now, as the Iewes had.</note> neither is it needfull wee ſhould; ſeeing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is plainly and euidently ſet before our eyes.

<note place="margin">VVe muſt goe out of our ſelues to attaine true felicitie.

Then we ſhall come vnto it, when wee are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the rule and paterne which he ſets before vs in his perſon. Now the Apoſtle ſhewes that this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie conſiſts in this, that wee reſt from our owne workes: whereupon it followes, that a man is made bleſſed when he renounceth himſelfe. What is it then to reſt from our owne workes, but the mortification of the fleſh: that is to wit, when a man renounceth himſelfe to liue to God? For when we ſpeake of the rule of liuing well and holily, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies begin at this, that man being dead in himſelfe, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God to liue in him: that he ceaſe from his owne workes, to giue God place to worke in him. For it muſt needes bee confeſſed that the life is then well ordered, when it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to God. Now ſuch is the corruption of our nature, that this will neuer be brought to paſſe, vntill we ceaſe from our owne workes. There is (I ſay) ſuch a repugnancie betweene the gouernment of God and our affections, that hee cannot worke in vs, vnleſſe wee reſt. But for as much as the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this reſt is neuer in this life, wee muſt daily ſtriue to come vnto it. The faithfull then doe enter into it, but it is vpon condition that they profit daily in preſſing to the marke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I doubt not but the Apoſtle of ſet purpoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7791:41"/>to the Sabbath day, to the ende he might withdrawe the Iewes from the externall obſeruation of it. For the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing thereof cannot be vnderſtood, vnleſſe we know the ſpirituall ende for which it was inſtituted. And therefore the Apoſtle vnder this one, aimes at two things. For in praiſing the excellencie of Gods grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he drawes vs to receiue it by faith: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and yet in the meane while, he ſhewes by the way the true manner of obſeruing the Sabbath: to the ende the Iewes ſhould no longer abuſe themſelues by ſtaying in the outward ceremonie. True it is, he ſpeakes not directly of the aboliſhing thereof, becauſe it was not his purpoſe; but in ſhewing that this ceremonie had another end; he thus draws them by litle and litle from that ſuperſtitious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they had of it. For whoſoeuer vnderſtands that the commandement had an other ende beſides the externall reſt, or an earthly obſeruation; ſuch a one looking vnto Chriſt, knowes by and by that the vſe of the ceremony is aboliſhed by his comming. For as ſoone as the bodie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, the ſhadows vaniſh away. Wherefore a man ought alwaies in the firſt place, carefully to ſhew that Chriſt is the end of the law.</p>

Now before we paſſe any further, we muſt ſee whether the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the word in generall, or whether he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this to the faithfull in particular. For it is certaine (and we may ſee it cleerely) that the word is not effectuall indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently and equally in all. For the vertue thereof manifeſts it ſelfe in the elect, that being humbled in the true acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of themſelues, they ſhould haue their recourſe to the grace of Chriſt: which cannot be done vnleſſe it pierce into the very depth of the heart. For hypocriſie, which hath many darke corners, and wonderfull conueiances in the heart of man, muſt be caſt out: neither is it enough that we feele ſome light prickings; but we muſt be pierced and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the bottome, that ſo beeing ouerwhelmed with the feeling of eternall death, we may learne to die to our ſelues. In a word, wee ſhall neuer be wholy renued in the ſpirit of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7791:42"/>our mind (which S. <hi>Paul</hi> notwithſtanding commands, Eph. 4.23.) till our old man be ſlaine by the ſtroke of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſword. And therefore in another place the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that the faithfull are ſacrificed to God by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, Phil. 2.17. why? becauſe they could not be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obedience of God, vnleſſe their owne will were brought to nothing: neither could they otherwiſe receiue the light of Gods diuine wiſdome, vnleſſe the light of the fleſh by wiſdome were put out. As for the reprobates, no ſuch thing can be perceiued in them, for either they proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemne God ſpeaking vnto them, yea they ſpare not to deride him; or elſe they murmure againſt his doctrine, &amp; obſtinately kicke and ſpurne againſt it.
<note place="margin">The hearts of the reprobates compared to the Anuill.</note> So that euen as the word of God is an hammer, ſo haue they alſo an heart as the anuill, driuing the blowes backe againe, be they neuer ſo mightie. And therefore it is vnpoſſible the word of God ſhould pierce ſo farre in them, as to come to the <hi>diuiſion of the ſoule and of the ſpirit.</hi> For this cauſe it ſeemes that this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ought only to be reſtrained to the faithfull; ſeeing none but they doe examine themſelues thus to the quicke. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the cohere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the text of the Apoſtle ſhews, that it is a generall ſentence, which extends it ſelfe euen to the reprobates. For although they be not ſoftened by it, but doe ſet hearts of iron and ſteele againſt God and his word, yet muſt they neceſſarily be ſhut vp vnder their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. It is true they laugh; but it is the laughter of an hoſtler, as they ſay; for they feele themſelues wrung as it were within: many ſhiftings and turnings they make that they might not come neere the iudgement ſeat of God: but thither are they drawne will they nill they, euen by this word, againſt which they ſo proudly exalt themſelues. So then we may compare them to madde dogges, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bite and ſcratch the chaine, yet they gaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe they ſtill remaine faſt tied therewith. Now howſoeuer this effect of the word doth not ſhewe it ſelfe at the firſt day, yet by the euent at the laſt you ſhall know, that the word is not preached to any man in vaine. Verily it is a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7791:42"/>generall ſentence which Chriſt pronounceth when he ſaith, The Spirit ſhall come and reproue the world of ſin, Ioh. 16.8. But how doth the Spirit exerciſe this reproofe? Verily by the Goſpell preached. Laſtly, although the word of God hath not alwaies this power in men, yet it hath this power incloſed in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle diſputes here of the nature and proper office of it, onely to the end we might know that as ſoone as it hath ſounded in our eares, our conſciences are foorthwith arraigned before Gods iudgement ſeate, and found guiltie. As if hee ſhould ſay, If any man bee of that minde that hee thinkes it is but a beating of the aire in vaine when the word of God is preached, he greatly erreth and deceiues himſelfe. For the word is <hi>liuely,</hi> and full of ſecret efficacie, which leaues no part of a man vntouched. This is the ſumme then of theſe words, to wit, that as ſoon as the Lord hath opened his ſacred mouth, all our ſenſes ought forthwith to be open and to receiue his word. Why? becauſe he will not ſpeake in vaine, as if his words ſhould either vaniſh, or fall to the ground, or as if no account were to bee made of them: but he ſpeakes with efficacie to the conſciences of men, that he might ſubiect them vnto himſelfe. The cauſe therefore why he giues ſuch vertue to his word is, that it might ſearch all the parts of the ſoule; examine the thoughts, and diſcerne betweene the affections: in a word, that it might ſhew it ſelfe to be our Iudge.</p>
               <p>But here a new queſtion may ariſe, to wit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſtion. </seg>
                  </label> whether this is to be vnderſtood of the Law or of the Goſpell. They which thinke the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Law, bring theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that it is the miniſterie of death, 2. Cor. 3.6.7. that it is a killing letter, that it brings nothing but wrath, and ſuch like. But the Apoſtle in this place alſo notes diuers other effects. For as wee haue ſaid, there is a liuely killing of the ſoule, which is done by the Goſpell. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> Let vs know then that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the whole doctrine of God, when he ſaith it is liuely, and mightie in operation. To the ſame purpoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> proteſts that his preaching was the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7791:43"/>ſweete ſauour of life vnto life to the faithfull,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> and of death vnto death in the vnfaithfull: ſo as God neuer ſpeakes in vaine, but either he thereby brings his owne to ſaluation; or els thereby caſts the wicked headlong into perdition. And this is the power of binding and loſing which the Lord committed to his Apoſtles, Matth. 18.18. This is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power whereof <hi>Paul</hi> glorieth in the 2. Cor. 10 4. And indeede it doth neuer promiſe vs ſaluation in Chriſt; but on the contrarie it openly denounceth vengeance to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, who in reiecting of Chriſt, doe plunge themſelues ouer head and eares in death.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee muſt note that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the word of God as it is brought vs by the miniſterie of men. For theſe are but railings and pernicious diſcourſes of them who ſay, it is true that the inſpired word hath indeed his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie, but the word which proceedes from the mouthes of men, is dead and without effect. I confeſſe the efficacie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes not from the tongues of men, neither conſiſts it in the bare ſound, but the efficacie is wholy to be giuen to the Spirit of God: and yet notwithſtanding al this lets not that the holy Ghoſt ſhould not manifeſt his power by the word preached. For in regard that God ſpeakes not perſonally himſelfe, but by men; the Apoſtle doth ſo much the more inſiſt vpon this, that the word ſhould not be receiued hand ouer head, or in contempt becauſe men are the miniſters of it. Accordingly, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> calles the Goſpell the power of God, Rom. 1.16. he doth expreſſely adorne it with this title of preaching; the which hee ſaw to bee a matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto ſome, and of contempt vnto others. And where he teacheth in another place, that ſaluation is made ours by the doctrine of faith, hee expreſſely giues it the title of that which is preached, Rom. 10.8. Wee ſee how God alwaies doth preciſely commend the doctrine which is adminiſtred vnto vs by men, to the end hee might hold vs in the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obedience of it.
<note place="margin">Preaching muſt not be contemned.</note> Now in that the word is called <hi>liuely,</hi> it muſt be ſupplied as hauing relation vnto vs: which is the better vnderſtood by the ſecond epithite: for in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7791:43"/>this word is <hi>mightie,</hi> he ſhewes wherein the life of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. For the Apoſtles meaning is to ſhew what the vſe of the word is in regard of vs. Now as touching the ſimilitude of a <hi>ſword,</hi> the Scripture vſeth it alſo in other places: but the Apoſtle not content with the ſimple compariſon, ſaith, that the word of God is <hi>ſharper than any ſword,</hi> yea than any <hi>two edged ſword:</hi> becauſe in that time they commonlie wore ſwords which had but one edge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And diuideth betweene the ſoule and the ſpirit.]</hi> This word <hi>ſoule</hi> is often taken for the ſpirit: but when the ſoule and ſpirit are ioyned together, then the ſoule compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends vnder it all the affections: and the ſpirit compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the power or facultie of the vnderſtanding. And thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſiring of God that he would conſerue the ſoules,
<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.23.</note> the ſpirits and bodies of the Theſſalonians pure and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vnto the comming of Chriſt, deſires nothing els, but that they may continue pure and chaſt in minde, in will, and in all their externall actions. Likewiſe when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, With my ſoule haue I deſired thee in the night, and with my ſpirit haue I ſought thee in the morning: his meaning is that hee was ſo attent in ſeeking God, that hee applied his whole minde and heart thereunto, Iſai. 26.9. I know others doe expound it otherwiſe; but I hope all that are of ſound iudgement will eaſily agree with me. Let vs now returne to the preſent text. The word of God reacheth euen to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding <hi>betweene the ſoule and the ſpirit:</hi> that is to ſay, it exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the whole life of man. For it pearceth euen to the thoughts of the minde, and ſoundeth the will, with all the deſires of the ſame. To the ſame end tends that which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the <hi>ioynts, and marrow:</hi> for his meaning is, that there is nothing ſo hard or maſſie in man, nor nothing ſo ſecret and hidden, but the efficacie of this word will reach into it.</p>
               <p>And that is it which S. <hi>Paul</hi> meanes when he ſaith, that prophecie ſerueth to reprooue and iudge men, euen to the reuealing of the ſecrets of their hearts, 1. Cor. 14.24. Truly howſoeuer it be the office of Chriſt to diſcouer &amp; bring to light the ſecret thoughts of the heart, yet for the moſt part
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7791:44"/>he doth this by his Goſpell. The word then performeth the office of a Iudge: becauſe it plucks the ſpirit of man as out of a labyrinth in which before it lay inwrapped, and kept it ſelfe cloſe, and brings it foorth into the Sunne light, to the end knowledge and iudgement may paſſe vpon it. For no darknes is ſo thicke as infidelitie is:
<note place="margin">No darknes like inſidelitie; nor any blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: but the word preached diſcouers both.</note> and hypocriſie blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth after an horrible faſhion. The word of God ſcattereth this darknes, &amp; caſteth off this hypocriſie quite and cleane. From thence proceedes that diſcerning and iudgement whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh; for the vices which before were hidden vnder a vaine pretence and appearance of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are now perceiued and knowne, the deceit being taken away. Now although the reprobates remaine for a time hidden in their lurking holes, yet notwithſtanding in the end they feele that the light of the word ſhineth euen thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as they cannot eſcape the iudgement of God. And from thence ariſeth their murmurings and rage. For if they were not ſmitten with the word, they would not manifeſt their furie as they doe: they would rather ſcorne it, or wind themſelues out of the power of it: they would alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to diſſemble the matter: but God will not ſuffer them to ſcape ſo. Therefore as ſoone as they doe begin to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at the word, or to be inflamed againſt it, they thereby confeſſe that they feele the force of it within them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of their teeth, kick they neuer ſo much againſt it.</p>

And ſo to confirme this ſentence, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hidden in man,</hi> which ſhall not bee iudged by the word of God; he takes an argument from the nature of God. <hi>No creature,</hi> ſaith he, can be hidden before God: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then is ſo deep in the ſoule, which ſhal not be drawne into the light by his word, which reſembles him that is the author of it. For as it is the office of God to ſearch the harts, ſo doth he alſo exerciſe this knowledge and iudgement by his word. The expoſitors not taking heede to this: to wit, that the word of God is as a plummet, by the which hee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7791:44"/>diues into the bottome of mens hearts, and ſearcheth and feeleth whatſoeuer is hidden therein, haue offered violence to this whole text, and yet were not able to winde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out. But all the difficultie is taken away if you make the argument ſtand thus, That we are therefore to obey the word of God purely and with a true affection of heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God who knowes the hearts, hath aſſigned this office to his word to pierce euen into the very deepeſt thoughts of the ſame. They haue alſo deceiued themſelues in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Greeke word, which is ſomewhat ambiguous. For they haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated, Of whom we ſpeak; where it ought rather to be turned, <hi>with whom we haue to doe.</hi> The meaning whereof is, that it is God who offereth himſelfe vnto vs, or with whom we haue to doe, and therefore wee are to take heede we dallie not with him as with a mortall man: but to tremble as often as his word is propounded vnto vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing is ſo ſecret which is not <hi>naked and manifest before his eyes.</hi>

               <p>As touching this word <hi>compaſſion,</hi> I will not ſtand diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too ſubtilly about it.

Truly the Apoſtle had no intent to buſie our heads with ſuch idle ſpeculations: but onely ſhewes that we neede not ſeeke farre for a Mediator, becauſe Chriſt reacheth forth his hand vnto vs before we enquire after him.

Thirdly, that we haue no occaſion to feare that he ſhould not be touched with any compaſſion to doe vs good as if himſelfe had neuer taſted of miſeries; for he hath borne our infirmities, to the ende he might be the better inclined to ſuccour vs.</p>
               <p>The whole ſpeech then of the Apoſtle ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the ſenſe of faith, becauſe he doth not ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute what Chriſt is in himſelfe, but rather what he is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of vs. By this word of <hi>likeneſſe,</hi> he meanes the agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the nature; thereby ſignifying that Chriſt by putting on our nature, hath alſo taken our affections, not onely to the end he might declare himſelfe to be true man, but alſo that he might learne by experience to giue ſuccour to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Not that the ſonne of God had neede of ſuch rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or inſtructions, but becauſe we could not otherwiſe comprehend in our mindes the care which he hath of our ſaluation. As often then as we are burthened and faint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the infirmities of our fleſh, let vs remember that the Son of God hath both felt, and had experience of the like; to the end he might ſuſtaine vs by his power, that we ſhould not be ouerwhelmed vnder them. But here it may be asked, what he means by <hi>infirmities:</hi> for this word is taken in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7791:46"/>ſignifications. Some thinke he meanes heate, cold, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirſt, and ſuch other bodily infirmities: as alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, pouertie, and the like, as we may ſee in many places of <hi>Paul,</hi> but ſpecially in the 2. Cor. 12.10. But their opinion is the beſt, who with pouerties and outward miſeries doe alſo comprehend afflictions of minde, as feare, ſorrowe, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of death, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>And indeed this reſtraint, <hi>without ſinne,</hi> ſhould otherwiſe be in vaine. For by reaſon of the peruerſitie of our nature, our affections are alwaies vitious, but they were exempt from all vice in Chriſt, becauſe in him there was a ſoueraign vprightneſſe, and a puritie moſt perfect. It is certaine that ſickneſſes, and pouerties, together with the things which are without vs, are not imputed as ſinnes. Wherefore when he ſpeaketh of the infirmities which are neere vnto ſinne, wee need not doubt but he meant the affections of the Spirit, to which mans nature is ſubiect becauſe of his infirmitie: for herein the condition of Angels is better than ours, that they are not ſubiect to feare, or ſorrow; as alſo that they are not combred with cares, or with the feare of death. Chriſt hath willingly taken vpon him theſe infirmities, and it was alſo his pleaſure to fight againſt them, not onely to conquer them for vs; but that we ſhould alſo be aſſuredly perſwaded that he is neere vnto vs, as often as we feele any by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them. For this cauſe he was not onely made man eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, but alſo tooke vpon himſelfe the qualities of mans nature. There is alwaies a reſtraint added, <hi>without ſinne:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are euermore to obſerue this difference betweene the affections of Chriſt, and ours: That Chriſts were alwaies well ordered according to the true rule of iuſtice: but ours, which proceede from a troubled fountaine, doe alwaies ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of their originall nature, becauſe they are out of frame and diſordered.</p>

<note place="margin">All religion falls to the ground: where aſſurance of ſaluation is taken from mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> where this aſſurance is taken away from mens conſciences. From whence we may eaſily gather that the light of the Goſpel was quenched in the Papacie, where the poore miſerable people are commanded to doubt whether God will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and fauorable, or whether he wil be angrie with them. They command men indeed to ſeeke God; but they ſhewe them not the way by which they may come vnto him: nay rather they euen ſhutte vp the gate, which onely giues them entrance. I grant they confeſſe that Chriſt is a Mediatour in the Generall; but when it comes to the point, they aboliſh the vertue of his Prieſthood, and diſpoyle him of his honor. For this is a ſure point, that where Chriſt is knowne indeede to be the true Mediatour, there forthwith doth all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings vaniſh, that may any way cauſe vs to ſuſpect whether we may haue acceſſe vnto God or no. Otherwiſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles conſequence in this place, <hi>We haue ſuch an high Prieſt which is readie to helpe vs,</hi> were to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to goe boldly <hi>to the throne of grace,</hi> with aſſurance and confidence. For if we were throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Chriſt doth willingly reach vs his hand, who is it that would not conceiue full boldneſſe to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before this throne? That which I haue ſaid then is true, to wit, that men doe take the vertue of Chriſt his Prieſthood away from him, as long as they ſtand in doubt, and vexe themſelues in ſeeking Mediators here and there, as if Chriſt alone were not ſufficient: vpon whoſe interceſſion whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reſts himſelfe indeed, as the Apoſtle here commandeth, he may aſſure himſelfe that his praiers are heard. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this aſſurance is, that the throne of God doth not preſent ſuch a maieſtie as ſhould aſtoniſh vs; but it is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a new title, that is to ſay, <hi>of grace:</hi> which alwaies ought to be freſh in our memories, when we flie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. For it cannot be but the glorie of God ſhould ſwallowe vs vp by and by with deſpaire, if that alone
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7791:47"/>come into our mindes: and ſo, his throne ſhall be fearefull vnto vs indeede. The Apoſtle therefore to remedie this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, and to deliuer our mindes from feare and trembling, doth cloath it with grace, and giues a name vnto it that might draw vs by the ſweetnes thereof. As if he ſhould ſay, ſince God doth hang out of his throne an enſigne of grace, &amp; of his fatherly loue towards vs, we haue no cauſe to feare that his maieſtie ſhould beat vs backe, or hinder vs to goe vnto him. The ſumme is, that we call vpon God boldly with full confidence, ſince we knowe that he is become fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs; and that we doe this by the meanes of Chriſt: as it is ſaid, Eph. 3.12.

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7791:48"/>all men are of one nature and fleſh. But now hee toucheth another thing, to wit, that the Prieſt ought to ſupport ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with compaſſion, becauſe he is partaker of their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. The Greeke word which the Apoſtle here vſeth, hath been diuerſly expounded as well by Latins as Greekes. For mine owne part I thinke it is ſimply taken to applie himſelf to compaſſion. True it is that all which is ſaid of the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prieſts, agrees not vnto Chriſt. For we know that Chriſt was exempt from all contagion of ſinne: wherefore he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from others in this regard that he had no neede to offer ſacrifices for himſelfe: but it ſufficeth that he alſo bare our infirmities, being notwithſtanding pure and voide of ſinne. Thus as touching the Prieſts vnder the law then, the Apoſtle ſaith that they were ſubiect to humane infirmities: and therefore were faine to make reconciliation for their owne ſinnes by ſacrifices, that they might not only meekly beare with the faults of others, but alſo might haue compaſſion vpon them. Now this part ought ſo to be applied to Chriſt, that in the meane while wee muſt carefully adde thereunto that exception whereof mention was made erewhile: to wit, that hee bare and taſted of our infirmities; but without ſinne. For although he were alwaies free from ſinne, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the onely feeling of thoſe infirmities, whereof he hath ſpoken, were of ſufficient force in him, to encline his heart to ſuccour vs, and to make him gentle and readie to pardon vs; as alſo carefull of our miſeries. The ſumme is, that Chriſt is not onely our brother in regard of the vnion of our fleſh and nature, but alſo by partaking with vs of our infirmities he is allured, nay faſhioned and framed to beare with vs, and to bee very lowly and gratious vnto vs. The Greeke word which wee tranſlate, <hi>who can,</hi> imports more than if wee ſhould ſay in our common ſpeech, is able, or, is mightie: for it is taken for one that is fit, or capable. Theſe words, <hi>the ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the way,</hi> are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſinners after the manner of the Hebrues. And of this we are to ſpeake more hereafter.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7791:48"/>we haue to note, firſt the ſimilitude, and then the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it. The calling of God makes the office lawfull, for none can exerciſe the ſame in good ſort as he ought, if he be not created of God. This is common to Chriſt and to <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> that both were called of God: but in this they differ, that in as much as Chriſt ſucceeded <hi>Aaron</hi> for a newe and diuers reſpect, and was ordained to be a perpetuall high Prieſt, it appeares that the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> was but temporarie, and to be aboliſhed. Now we ſee the Apoſtles drift. The right of the office of Prieſthood was to be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to Chriſt: he doth it in ſhewing that God is the author of it. But this is not yet ſufficient, vnleſſe it appeares that the auncient Prieſthood ceaſed, to giue place to this. He proues it, becauſe we muſt haue an eie to the Condition whereunto <hi>Aaron</hi> was ordained a Prieſt (for it lieth not in vs to ſtretch it further then Gods ordinance will beare) and he will by and by ſhew how long Gods wil was, this firſt order ſhould laſt. Chriſt then is a lawfull Prieſt, becauſe he was ordained by Gods authoritie. What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of thoſe that ſucceeded him? Truely they had power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ſo farre forth as it was giuen them of God, and not as the ſame was attributed vnto them by the opinion of men.</p>
               <p>Now although this be ſpoken in regard of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſpeech which is here handled; yet from hence may be gathered a generall doctrine: to wit, that no gouernment is to be brought into the Church at the luſt and pleaſure of men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but ought rather to tarrie and waite for the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God: alſo, that a certaine and ſet rule is to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in election and choice of miniſters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that ſo none intrude himſelfe after his own fantaſie.
<note place="margin">Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment muſt not beſquared according to mens appetites, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God.</note> We muſt diſtinctly note both theſe points. For the Apoſtle ſpeakes not here onely of perſons, but alſo of the office. He denies, I ſay, that office which men forge without commandement, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ordinance of God, to be holy or lawfull. For as it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs to God to gouerne the Church, ſo doth he alſo wholy reſerue vnto himſelfe both the power of limiting
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7791:49"/>the way, and the rule of the adminiſtration thereof. From whence I conclude, that the Prieſthood of the Popedome is a baſtard Prieſthood, becauſe it hath beene forged in the ſhoppe of mans inuention. What one text of ſcripture is there wherein God commands that wee ſhould now offer ſacrifice vnto him for the purgation of ſinnes? neither hath he ordained that Prieſts ſhould be created to this ende. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Pope then ordaine his ſhauelings for to offer ſacrifice,
<note place="margin">Chriſt would not runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſent, but waited for a calling from his father</note> the Apoſtle ſaith that we are not to hold them for lawfull: vnleſſe peraduenture they haue ſome newe priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to exalt themſelues aboue Chriſt: who yet durſt not take this honour to himſelfe of his own motion, but waited for a calling from his Father.</p>
               <p>This alſo ought to haue place in regard of perſons; to the ende no priuate man ſhould take this honour to himſelfe, vnleſſe publike authoritie goe alwaies before. I ſpeake of the offices which otherwiſe are ordained of God. It may ſo fall out ſometimes I denie not, but he which ſhall not be called of God (howſoeuer for that cauſe he is the leſſe to be approoued of) ought notwithſtanding to be ſuffered, if ſo be his office be holy &amp; approoued of God.
<note place="margin">Thoſe that haue a lawfull outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are not raſhly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, though they want the</note> For often times many thruſt in themſelues, and enter into this function by ambition, or other vnlawfull and wicked meanes, who are no way aſſured of their calling: and yet notwithſtanding they muſt not be reiected by and by; but eſpecially then, when it cannot be done by the publike cenſure of the Church. Two hundred yeares before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, there were filthy corruptions, &amp; great abuſes which raigned in the manner of gouerning, or rather in the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the high Prieſt: and yet notwithſtanding as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the office it ſelfe, the power and authoritie of the ſtate remained ſtill, by reaſon the calling was of God. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were indured, becauſe the libertie of the Church was oppreſſed. Whereby it appeares that the great and chiefeſt fault is in the kind of the office: that is to wit, when men take vpon them of themſelues to inuent a calling in the Church, which God hath no way commanded. So much the leſſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7791:49"/>then are thoſe Prieſts which the Pope hath made, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; who to prooue themſelues ſuch as ought to be held for ſacred and holy, doe with full mouth inceſſantly alleage their great titles: and yet notwithſtanding they haue choſen them themſelues, without asking either counſell or leaue of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee.]</hi> It may ſeeme that this ſentence is farre fetched. For although it be graunted that Chriſt was begotten of God the Father, doth that conclude therefore that he was ordained a Prieſt by him alſo? But if we conſider to what ende Chriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to the world, we ſhall eaſily perceiue that this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doth neceſſarily appertaine vnto him. But withall, we muſt alſo call that againe to minde which we haue ſaid in the firſt chapter: to wit, that this generation of Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Pſalme ſpeaketh, is a teſtimonie that the Father hath giuen him to men. Wherefore this word is not put here to ſignifie a mutuall relation between the Father and the Son, but is rather to be referred vnto men, to whom he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted after an high and excellent manner. But what is it that God hath manifeſted vnto vs in his Sonne? is it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honour, or without any power at all? nay, hath he not rather manifeſted him to be ſuch a one as is fitte to be the Mediator betweene God and men? And therefore this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or begetting, containeth alſo the Prieſthood.</p>

For there is ſcarcely to be found a more manifeſt propheſie, either of the eternall Prieſthood, or kingdome of Chriſt, than this; And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Iewes labour with might and maine to picke quarrels on euery ſide to darken the glorie of Chriſt: but they gaine nothing by it. For whereas they drawe that which is there ſpoken to <hi>Dauid,</hi> as if it were he that ſhould be at the right hand of God: It is too blockiſh an impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

If they reply that Princes are ſometimes called by the name <hi>Cohenim,</hi> which is here vſed: I confeſſe it, but withall I denie that this agrees with this preſent place: for the compariſon leaues no ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was the Prieſt of God.

               <p>Whereas the Greekes haue tranſlated <hi>after the order;</hi> in the Hebrew it is word for word As, or, according to the forme, or after the faſhion of.

Whence it appeares that our faith is confirmed, and his honour no way dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by this his bearing of our miſeries.

Now no man doubts but <hi>the daies of his fleſh,</hi> ſhould be here taken for the life preſent.

Theſe fantaſticall ſpirits then doe altogether dote, who haue dreamed that Chriſt is now diſpoyled of his fleſh, becauſe it is here ſaid, When he was in the fleſh. For there is great difference betweene being a true man (although in the bleſſed eſtate of immortalitie) and to be ſubiect to the miſeries and infirmities of man, which he endured whileſt hee liued in this world: but now hath put them off, being entred into heauen.</p>

<note place="margin">Chriſts prayer vvas heard, and yet he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death.</note> Chriſt which was the Sonne, ſought for remedie to his Father, who was heard; and yet notwithſtanding endured death: that by

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is this, that Chriſt ſought remedie at his hands who was able to ſaue him, that hee might be deliuered from his troubles. And this he ſaith to the end none ſhould thinke that Chriſt had an heart of braſſe without feeling. For we muſt alwaies conſider to what end euery thing is ſpoken. If Chriſt had not bin touched with any ſorrow, what conſolation would haue come vnto vs by his paſſions? But when we heare that he felt not bodily paines alone, but alſo endured ſharp tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his ſpirit, herein is the ſimilitude ſhewed between him and vs. For when Chriſt (ſaith he) endured death and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſeries, it was not to the end he ſhould ſet them light, or not be touched with any feeling of them: for he prayed with cries, and teares, by which hee gaue teſtimonie of the great anguiſh that was in his heart. The Apoſtle then by theſe teares, and ſtrong cries would expreſſe a vehement do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: it being an ordinarie manner of ſpeech to note out that which was done, by the ſignes. Neither do I doubt but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7791:51"/>that he ſpeakes of that prayer which the Euangeliſts recite: to wit, Father, if it bee poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me, Matth. 26.39. Alſo another time, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? For the Euangeliſts recite, that in this ſecond prayer there was a great crie: In the firſt, wee muſt not imagine that his eyes were drie, whileſt drops of blood trickled from his bodie, by reaſon of the great ſorrow hee was in. For it is moſt certaine he was then ſhut vp vnder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme anguiſhes. We need not doubt then whether he were preſſed with true ſorrowes or no, ſeeing he did thus earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray vnto his Father for ſuccour. But what vſe hath this? Truly that as often as we are preſſed vnder temptations, we learne to faſten all our ſenſes vpon the Sonne of God, who felt the like. Seeing hee goeth before vs then,
<note place="margin">VVhat we are to doe in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> wee haue no cauſe to be out of heart. And withall wee are admoniſhed not to ſue vnto any for deliuerance out of our miſeries, but to God alone. For what better rule of prayer can wee haue than the example of Chriſt? Now he directed his prayer to none but to his Father: O my Father (ſaith he) if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, &amp;c. Matth. 26.39. And the Apoſtle ſheweth vs that we are to doe the like, when he ſaith that Chriſt <hi>offered vp pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to him that was able to ſaue him from death.</hi> For hereby he ſignifieth that Chriſt prayed rightly: becauſe he had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him that was truly bountifull, who is God onely.

For he calles <hi>the doctrine of beginning,</hi> the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which the ignorant are to begin, when they be receiued into the Church. Now in that he commands them to leaue ſuch rudiments, or beginnings, his meaning is, not that the faithfull ſhould forget them, but that they ſhould not ſticke faſt, as it were, in them: the which is better known by the ſimilitude of <hi>laying the foundation,</hi> which by and by followeth. For when an houſe is to be builded, men muſt neuer ſhrinke away from the foundation: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it were a mockerie to be alwaies about that, &amp; to goe no further. For howſoeuer the foundation of the building is to be laid, yet he which ſhall alwaies buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe about that, neuer fitting or preparing matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to raiſe vp the building; ſhall he not buſie himſelfe fooliſhly, and in vaine? In a word, as we are to beginne by the foundation, ſo the labour of the maſter builder is to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten that the houſe alſo be raiſed vp in due ſeaſon. The like is it in Chriſtianitie. For the foundation is laid in vs by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Wherefore thoſe who alwaies ſticke in the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, goe forward but ill; becauſe they propound no end vnto themſelues.

                  <hi>Of repentance from dead workes.]</hi> He had reſpect here to the forme vſed in the Catechiſme. From whence wee may draw a probable coniecture that this Epiſtle was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by and by after the publiſhing of the Goſpel, but rather after there was ſome forme of gouernment vſed in the Churches. The forme was, that he which was newly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in religion, made a confeſſion of his faith, before hee was baptized. Now there were certaine articles, the which the Paſtor demanded of them: as may be ſeene by many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the ancient Fathers: and the examination was chiefly vpon the confeſſion of faith, which wee commonly call the Symbole or Creede of the Apoſtles. This was as the firſt entrance into the Church, for thoſe who being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of age, meant to become Chriſtians; as thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were ſtrangers from the faith in Chriſt. The Apoſtle makes mention of this cuſtome, becauſe no long time was giuen to ſuch new conuerts to be taught in the firſt grounds of the Chriſtian religion. For a ſchoolmaſter teacheth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren their A, B, C: becauſe they might foorthwith come to know greater things.</p>
               <p>But let vs conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith. He names <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith,</hi> wherein conſiſts the whole perfection of the Goſpell. For what other thing doth Chriſt commaund to his Apoſtles, but that they ſhould preach faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Luk. 24.47. And therfore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that he had faithfully diſcharged his dutie, he alleageth for himſelfe that he had diligently and continually taught
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7791:55"/>them from houſe to houſe, to imprint theſe two things in the hearts of his Auditors, to wit, Repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Act. 20.20.21. May it not ſeeme abſurd then that the Apoſtle ſhould command them here to leaue faith and repentance, wherein they were to perſeuere the whole courſe of their liues? But in adding <hi>from dead workes,</hi> he ſhewes that he ſpeakes of the firſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when men began firſt to be Chriſtians. For although euery ſinne be a dead worke, becauſe it begets death, or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceedes from the ſpirituall death of the ſoule; yet notwithſtanding all the faithfull which are alreadie rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by the Spirit of God, are not properly ſaid to repent themſelues of dead workes. True it is, that regeneration is but begun in them; but how little ſoeuer this ſeede of the new life be in them, yet that is the cauſe why they are no more reputed dead in his ſight. Wherfore the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not all repentance in generall, wherein we ought carefully to meditate, and to exerciſe our ſelues day and night: but he onely meanes that beginning of repentance, by which thoſe who being euen newly conuerted to the faith, did enter into the way of newnes of life. Alſo the word <hi>faith,</hi> ſignifies that briefe ſumme of the doctrine of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which is commonly called the Articles of the Faith. Hereunto alſo appertaines, <hi>The reſurrection from the dead,</hi> and <hi>eternall iudgement.</hi> For theſe two things are the greateſt ſecrets of the heauenly wiſedome: yea euen the very marke of all our religion, whereat wee ought to aime all our whole life. But becauſe one and the ſame thing is taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the rude and ignorant, than to thoſe that haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſomewhat alreadie; the Apoſtle notes the common forme of queſtioning;
<note place="margin">The points of catechiſme v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Doeſt thou beleeue the reſurrection of the dead? Doest thou beleeue there is an eternall life?</hi> Theſe are things fit for children, and onely for once: wherefore to come and demaund the ſame things againe, were but to go backward.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7791:55"/>reade them together; <hi>of the doctrine of Baptiſmes:</hi> although I expound it otherwiſe than others doe: to wit, that it is a forme of ſpeech by way of appoſition, as the Grammarians call it: as thus, not laying againe the foundation of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of faith toward God, of the reſurrection from the dead: which is the doctrine of Baptiſmes, and the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands. Therefore if theſe two members, The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Baptiſmes, and the laying on of hands, be incloſed by a parentheſis, it will agree beſt with the order of the text. For if wee reade them not by way of appoſition, there will an abſurditie follow, in that one and the ſame thing is twice repeated. For what doctrine is there in Baptiſme, but that which he here recites of faith towards God, of repentance, of eternall iudgement, and ſuch like? Moreouer, <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> thinkes the Apoſtle puts Baptiſmes here in the plurall number, becauſe they did in a manner aboliſh the firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by returning to the firſt rudiments. To which opinion I agree not: for this doctrine is not appointed to many Baptiſmes. But hee calles Baptiſmes, the ceremonies and forme which they vſed in publike Baptiſme, or the daies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to baptiſe.</p>
               <p>He ioyneth the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> with Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as there were two orders of thoſe which were newly inſtructed, ſo was there alſo a double ceremonie. For thoſe who were ſtrangers came not to Baptiſme, till they had made confeſſion of their faith: therefore as touching theſe, the order of inſtruction and catechiſing went before Baptiſme. But the children of the faithfull, in as much as they were adopted from their mothers wombe, and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the bodie of the Church, by the right of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they were baptized from their infancie: and after they were growne to ſome diſcretion, and had been inſtructed in the faith, they alſo preſented them to be publikely catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus it was done to theſe after Baptiſme: but then an other ſigne was added, to wit, the impoſition of hands. This onely place witneſſeth ſufficiently that the originall of this ceremonie came from the Apoſtles: which notwithſtanding
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7791:56"/>hath ſince been turned to ſuperſtition: which the world hath almoſt alwaies been accuſtomed to doe with good and holy ordinances, erring and degenerating ſtill to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For ſome haue made vs beleeue it is a Sacrament, whereby the ſpirit of regeneration is conferred. By which fancie they haue diſmembred Baptiſme: for they haue tranſported that which is proper vnto it, to the impoſition of hands. Know we then that this ceremonie was inſtituted by the firſt authors, to the end it might be a ſolemne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prayer, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> calles it. True it is that by this ſigne they approoued of the faith of thoſe who were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die out of the ſtate of infancie: but they meant nothing leſſe than thereby to rent and teare in pieces the vertue of Baptiſme.
<note place="margin">The inſtitution of laying on of hands is to be retained: but the ſuperſtition muſt be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recled.</note> Wherefore wee are at this day to keepe the pure inſtitution, and to correct the ſuperſtition. Beſides, this place ſerueth vs to prooue the Baptiſme of little children. For to what purpoſe ſhould one ſelfeſame doctrine be called, to ſome the doctrine of Baptiſmes, and to others the laying on of hands: vnleſſe that the latter ſort were inſtructed in the faith, after they had alreadie receiued Baptiſme, ſo as there remained no more vnto them, but the impoſition of hands?</p>

Thoſe therefore of the Weſt eſpecially, haue doubted whether this Epiſtle were to be beleeued, becauſe they were preſſed with the Nouatian ſect, and had not knowledge enough to refute their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But when we haue skanned the Apoſtles meaning, we ſhall by and by ſee there is nothing here that doth any way fauour ſo abſurd an errour. Others who acknowledge the authoritie of this Epiſtle, and allow it for holy; willing to auoid the abſurditie, doe winde themſelues out from it, onely by way of cauill. For ſome there are who take this word <hi>impoſſible,</hi> for difficult, or, for a thing that very rarely comes to paſſe: the which is farre wide from the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word. There are ſome others, howbeit more in number; who reſtraine it to that repentance, whereby newe Conuerts were wont to be prepared vnto baptiſme in the auncient Church. A like matter; as if the Apoſtle had inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them that were conuerted to faſt, or to doe ſome ſuch like thing. Moreouer what great thing ſhould the Apoſtle haue ſaid, if he had denied that that kind of repentance which is but a dependance of Baptiſme, might be renued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? He threatens an horrible vengeance of God to fall vpon all thoſe that reiect the grace of God which they haue once receiued. What grauitie or waight were then I pray you in this ſentence, and what terrible thunderbolt were there in it to feare thoſe who were fooliſhly become ſecure and careleſſe, if ſo be it did only admoniſh vs that there were no place left for the firſt repentance? for ſo this would ſtretch it ſelfe to all kinde of ſinne. What ſhall we ſay then? for ſeeing the Lord offereth mercie to all without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what reaſon is there that any (by ſuch an abſurditie) ſhould
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7791:57"/>be debarred of it for any cauſe whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>The knot then of this queſtion is in theſe words, <hi>if they fall againe.</hi> So then whoſoeuer ſhal vnderſtand the force thereof, ſhall eaſily winde himſelfe out of all difficultie. Now it muſt be noted that there is a double falling: the one particular,
<note place="margin">Falles, general, and particular.</note> the other generall: He which hath failed in one kind, yea be it that he hath failed in many kinds, ſuch a one is fallen from the ſtate of a Chriſtian man. Thus all ſinnes are ſo many falls. But the Apoſtle diſputes not here of theft, periurie,
<note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between falling into ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinne: and a fiuall apoſtacie</note> murder, drunkennes, adulterie, or of ſome ſuch like vice; but he ſpeakes of a finall falling away from the goſpel, ſo as the ſinner offends not God onely in one kinde, but wholly renounceth his grace. And to the ende this may be the better vnderſtood, there muſt be an antitheſis ſupplied betweene the graces of God which he hath recited, and this fall.
<note place="margin">VVho they be that are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from hope of pardon.</note> For he falles away, who <hi>reuolts from the word of God,</hi> who <hi>quencheth the light of it, who depriues himſelfe of the taſt of the heauenly gift, who forſakes his participation of the holy Spirit.</hi> This is wholy to renounce God. We ſee now then, who they be whom hee excludeth from the hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: to wit, thoſe Apoſtatates, who runne away from the knowledge of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which before they had receiued; and from the grace of God; which cannot befall any, but ſuch a one as ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt. For he which violates the ſecond Table of the lawe, or tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the firſt table by ignorance, is not yet guiltie of ſuch a reuolting: neither doth God ſo depriue any of his grace (the Reprobate excepted) as that he leaues them without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of pardon.</p>

He calles it <hi>the partaking of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe it is he that diſtributes to euery one (according as he wil) al that light and vnderſtanding, without which none can ſay, that Ieſus is the Lord, 1. Cor. 12.3. as alſo that hee opens the eyes of our vnderſtanding, and reueales Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets vnto vs. He calles it <hi>the taste of the good word of God:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thereby ſignifying, that Gods will is not manifeſted vnto vs in the ſame hand oner head, but that it brings therewithall vnto vs a ſweete delectation. In a word, by this epithite hee ſhewes what difference there is betweene the Law and the Goſpell: becauſe the Law containes in it nothing but ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and iudgement: but the Goſpell is a ſweete and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious teſtimony of the loue of God, and of his fatherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards vs. Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he calles it <hi>the taſte of the powers of the world to come:</hi> whereby he ſignifies, that by faith we are receiued into the heauenly kingdome, that in ſpirit wee might behold that bleſſed immortalitie, which otherwiſe is hidden from our mindes.</p>
               <p>Let vs aſſure our ſelues then that the Goſpell is not knowne of vs to any purpoſe, but by the illumination of the holy Ghoſt: and that in ſuch wiſe, that being carried aboue

The earth, ſaith he, which drinkes in the raine, preſently after ſeed time if it brings not forth of the kernell a baſtard or wilde graſſe, is at the length brought to the ripeneſſe of good corne, by the bleſſing of God: ſo alſo they that receiue the ſeede of the Goſpel into their hearts, and of this ſeede doe bring forth a good and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blade, doe alwaies grow better and better, till they bring forth ripe fruite.

For there is nothing that doth more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs to heare the word of God, than when we ſee we are reputed for deſperate perſons. For this cauſe the Apoſtle here proteſts that he admoniſheth the Iews, becauſe he had good hope of them, and deſired to bring them to ſaluation. We gather from this practiſe of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">It is profitable that the elect themſelues ſhould be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſharpely reprooued.</note> that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to reprooue ſharpely, and with great vehemencie, not the Reprobates onely, but euen the Elect themſelues, and thoſe whome we account as the children of God.</p>

Thus the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who oppoſe the merits of workes to the grace of God, doe debate this point, and inſiſt vpon it very much; God, ſay they, is not vniuſt.

The Scripture euery where ſhews none other cauſe of our ſaluation, than the free mercie of God.

<note place="margin">Reward is not giuen vnto workes for any merit, but vpon Gods meere liberalitie.</note> but by the meere liberalitie of God. Yea euen this free recompence of works proceeding from the free bountie and liberalitie of God, hath no place till we be receiued into fauour by the meanes of Chriſt. We gather from hence then, that God in doing this, payes nothing that he owes vs, but keepes and fulfilles that promiſe, which of his free good will he hath made,
<note place="margin">God beholds not our works, but rather his own grace in our works.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beholds both our ſelues and our workes with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and pardon; or to ſpeake yet more properly, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not our works ſo much, as his own grace in our works. Now ye ſee how it is, that he <hi>forgets</hi> not our works, becauſe in them he acknowledgeth both himſelfe, and the worke of his Spirit. This is alſo that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which the Apoſtle meaneth, to wit, becauſe he cannot denie himſelfe. Thus this place is agreeable to the ſentence of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſaith, he which hath begun a good worke in you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it to the day of Chriſt, Philip. 1.6.

For <hi>Abraham</hi> had this in common with all the faithfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: but it is not without great cauſe that he was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and called the father of all the faithfull. No marueile therefore if the Apoſtle doe make ſpeciall choiſe of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others: as of him vnto whom hee would all men ſhould looke as oft as they would finde a cleere mirror of faith. He ſaith, <hi>faith and patience,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant faith which hath alſo patience ioyned therewith.

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:7791:61"/>by his owne name? This you ſee is the principall thing now in hand: but we are here to note two things by the way: firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that we ought to ſweare by the name of God, when we are required to ſweare: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, that an oath is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Chriſtians, becauſe it is a lawfull remedie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe contentions. God doth expreſly charge vs that we ſweare by his name: and if we mingle any other with his, he proteſts that it is a prophanation of an oath. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now there are three ſpeciall reaſons of this. For when we are deſtitute of the meanes to bring the truth to light, it is not lawfull to haue recourſe to any other than to God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who is himſelfe the eternall truth. Secondly, becauſe it is he who knoweth the hearts, Ierem. 17.10. His office is plucked from him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other is called to be a iudge in thoſe things which are hidden from the iudgement of men. Thirdly, becauſe that not onely in ſwearing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we call him to witneſſe; but we alſo meane thereby that he ſhould ſhew his vengeance vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the partie periured, if we ſpeake and ſweare falſely. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be marueiled at, if he be ſo ſeuerely angrie againſt them which ſweare by another name: for it is to take away from him ſo much of his honour.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the ſcripture doth ſometimes vſe other formes of ſwearing; that doth not croſſe this doctrine. For the faithfull doe not ſweare by the heauen or by the earth, as if they did attribute any diuinitie vnto them, but by ſuch indirect oathes, they haue reſpect to God onely. For there are diuers kinds of oathes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt and the cheifeſt is this, when we call God for iudge; and doe directly make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale vnto his iudgment ſeat. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, when we name the things that we loue greatly, as our life, our head, or ſome ſuch other like thing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third, when we take the creatures to witneſſe in Gods preſence. But in all theſe to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, we ſweare by none other than by God. Wherefore they who contend that it is lawfull to ioyne the Saints that are dead as companions with God, and that the right of puniſhing ſhould be attributed vnto them, ſuch doe no leſſe ſhew their malice than their beaſtlineſſe. Beſides, this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7791:61"/>this place as hath beene ſaid, teacheth,
<note place="margin">It is lawfull to take an oath.</note> that there is a lawfull vſe of an oath among Chriſtians: the which we are to note wel againſt thoſe giddie ſpirits, who would willingly bring out of vſe that holy rule of an oath which God hath giuen in his lawe. For out of queſtion the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of the manner of an oath, as of an holy thing allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued of God. And it is alſo to be noted that he doth not onely ſay that it was thus in vſe in old time, but alſo teſtifies that it laſteth euen yet to this day. Let vs then take an oath for an helpe to maintaine the truth, when we want other proofes.</p>

And hereby alſo we may ſee how profitable and neceſſarie it is to haue ſuch an aſſurance of the loue he beares vs, that we might haue no more accaſion to wauer or tremble.

For the truth is, that whileſt we flote vp and downe in the ſalt ſea of this world, we are not ſtaied vpon ſure and firme ground, but we reele as a ſhippe to and fro in the middeſt of the ſea, yea euen in a troubleſome ſea toſſed with floods and waues. For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell he ceaſeth not to raiſe vp infinite ſtormes and tempeſts that might at once ouerturne and drowne our ſhippe, if ſo be our anker be not deepely faſtened euen to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. And indeed let vs turne our cies whither ſoeuer wee will, we ſhall perceiue no firme land whereupon to ſtand ſafely: but which way ſoeuer our ſenſes doe turne them, we ſhall ſee nothing but water: yea ſuch waters, whoſe waues doe ſwell, and roare, lifting vp themſelues on high, &amp; threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening our deſtruction.

Herein ſtands the difference; that the anker is caſt downwards, becauſe it findes faſtening in the earth: and our hope is raiſed vp on high, and flieth into heauen, becauſe it findes nothing vpon earth,

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7791:62"/>neither yet any darknes be it neuer ſo thicke, that can let vs to cleaue ſtill faſt vnto him. Being thus made faſt vnto God, howſoeuer wee muſt fight indeede daily againſt infinite ſtormes and tempeſts, yet are we notwithſtanding ſo out of danger, that we ſhall not periſh with our ſhippe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, that it is an <hi>anchor both ſure and ſtedfast.</hi> For no tempeſtuouſnes of waues can be ſo great, that they ſhould be able to rent the anchor in pieces, or to breake the cable, or that the ſhippe by meanes thereof ſhould be clouen in twaine. This indeed falles out vpon the Sea: but the power of God is farre otherwiſe to ſuſtaine and keepe vs: and is otherwiſe alſo, as well in regard of the efficacie of hope, as of the ſtablenes of the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it entreth into that which is within the vaile.]</hi> We haue ſaid alreadie, that faith ſhall finde nothing which ſhall not be fleeting and vaniſhing, till it come neere vnto God: of neceſſitie therefore it muſt pearce euen into heauen. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle hath to doe with the Iewes, hee alludes to the ancient Tabernacle, and ſaith that they muſt not reſt themſelues in the things which are ſeene, but that they muſt enter euen into the ſecret place, which is hidden behind the vaile: as if he ſhould ſay, you muſt paſſe beyond all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall figures and old ſhadowes, that faith may reſt it ſelfe vpon Chriſt alone.

               <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Without father.]</hi> I had rather to ſay ſo, than of an vnknowne father, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> doth tranſlate. For the Apoſtle meant to ſignifie ſomething more expreſly, than to ſay that the race of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was vnknowne, or baſe, and of little renowme. Neither doe I greatly ſtand about the diſcuſſing of an obiection which ſome doe make here: to wit, if wee take it ſo, the truth ſhould not bee anſwerable to the figure, becauſe Chriſt hath a father in heauen, and a mother in earth. For the Apoſtle preſently after expounds his owne meaning, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when he addes <hi>without kinred.</hi> He doth then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> from the common order of being borne: thereby ſhewing that he was eternall, ſo as none are to goe ſearch out among men from what race he newly iſſued. It is certaine that he was begotten of a father and a mother: but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7791:63"/>the Apoſtle ſpeakes not of him as of a priuate man: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as of one clothed with the perſon of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he forbids vs to conſider ought in him but that which the Scripture teacheth. For in handling all thoſe things which belong to Chriſt, it is needfull to deale with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, that wee know nothing but that which proceedes out of the mouth of God. Now ſeeing the Spirit of God, bringing in the rareſt and moſt excellent King of that time, yet makes no mention at all of his birth, neither yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpeakes any one word of his death; is it not as much as if by this meanes his eternitie had been ſet foorth vnto vs? Now that which was ſhadowed in <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> was truly manifeſted in Chriſt. Thus then we are to content our ſelues with this mediocritie, that when the Scripture propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> vnto vs as a man that was neuer borne, or which neuer died; it ſhewes vnto vs as in a mirror, that there is neither beginning nor end in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, from hence we alſo learne what reuerence and ſobrietie is required to be in vs, as touching the ſpirituall myſteries of God. For the Apoſtle is not onely willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that which he findes not in the whole Scriptures, but would that wee ſhould be ignorant of it alſo. For que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe it is not lawfull to pronounce any thing of Chriſt at randon, nor yet after our ſhallow capacitie. <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> then is not to be conſidered here as a man of ſome meane place, but as an holy and ſacred figure of Chriſt. Neither are we to thinke that either his genealogie or death was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be ſpoken of by chance, or vnaduiſednes: but that the holy Ghoſt rather did it of purpoſe, to the end he might raiſe vp our mindes aboue the common order of men. For this cauſe their coniecture is very vnlikely who ſay, that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was <hi>Shem</hi> one of the ſonnes of <hi>Noah.</hi> For come we once to ſpeake of a certaine and knowne man, this third ſimilitude betweene <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> and Chriſt will not be firme. <hi>But was likened to the Sonne of God.</hi> That is to ſay, ſo farre foorth as the manner of likenes would beare.

Now <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the father of them all, did yet paie tithes to a Prieſt, which was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: it followeth then, that all the ſucceſſours of <hi>Abraham</hi> are inferiour to this Prieſt. Thus the right giuen to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, was particular aboue all the reſt of their brethren: But <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> is placed in an high degree aboue any of them, ſo as he holds them all vnderneath him.

It is a ſolemne praier, by which he that is placed in any excellent degree of honour, and publike office, doth recommend perſons, and thoſe that are committed vnto his gouernment particularly vnto God. There is alſo another kinde of bleſſing; which is when we pray one for another: a thing common among all the faithfull. But this bleſſing whereof the Apoſtle here makes mention, is a ſigne of a farre greater power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Thus <hi>Iſaack</hi> bleſſed his ſonne <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the ſonnes of Ioſeph. Gen. 27.27. Gen. 48.15. For this was not a mutuall acte, wherein the ſonne may doe as much for the father: but to the ende this bleſſing might be duely and lawfully performed, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that he which did it ſhould be a ſuperiour, &amp; ſhould be in authoritie alſo aboue him whom hee bleſſed. Which is the better vnderſtood by the 6. of Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, 27. where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement beeing giuen to the Prieſts to bleſſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the promiſe is by and by added: to wit, that thoſe whom they bleſſed, ſhould be bleſſed of God. The bleſſing I ſay which the Prieſts pronounced was confirmed and ratified with ſuch authoritie, that it was not ſo much the authoritie of men as the authoritie of God. For euen as in offering of ſacrifices the Prieſt did repreſent the perſon of Chriſt, ſo alſo in bleſſing of the people he was but the miniſter and imbaſſadour of the high God. In this ſenſe alſo is that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be taken, whereof mention is made, Luk. 24.50. where Chriſt after he had lead his Apoſtles out of Bethania, lifted vp his hands on high and bleſſed them. No doubt he tooke this geſture of lifting vp the hands from the high Prieſts, to the ende he might ſhewe himſelfe to be he by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7791:65"/>whom God the Father bleſſeth vs. This bleſſing alſo is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Pſal. 116.17. and 118.1. Now let vs apply this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to that which he handleth. Seeing the bleſſing of the Prieſt is a worke of God, ſo it is alſo a witneſſe of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, and of the excellent honour which God imparted vnto him. <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> then tooke vnto himſelfe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree in that he bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi> For he did it not at randon, but according to the right and authoritie of his Prieſtly function: it followes then that he is <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.

True it is this hath no place in others, but there is great reaſon why it ſhould haue place in <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> becauſe he is the image and figure of Chriſt: for in as much as the queſtion is here of the ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt, and of his Prieſthood; humane conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ought to haue no place: neither is it lawfull to knowe any more than that which the ſcriptures doe ſet before vs. Yet we are not to gather from hence, that this man who met <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhould be yet liuing: as ſome haue fooliſhly imagined. For this is to be referred to the qualitie of the perſon which <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> ſuſtained: to wit, in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the perſon of the ſonne of God. Moreouer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle mindes to ſhew by theſe words, that the dignitie of <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> Prieſthood is perpetuall, whereas the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Leuites was but for a time. For thus he frames his argument, Thoſe to whom the law aſſignes tithes to be paid, are mortall men: in which is ſhewed that the right of that Prieſthood was once to be aboliſhed, in regard they ended their liues. But the ſcripture makes no mention at all of the death of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> when it ſpeakes of the tithes that were paid vnto him: thus then he limits not the right of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7791:65"/>his Prieſthood within any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of time, but rather cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews that it endures for euer. Now this he addes, to the end it might not ſeeme that the law which immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed did derogate any thing from the firſt, as the cuſtome in other things is. For otherwiſe ſome might haue replied that this right of Prieſthood which <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> enioyed, is now aboliſhed, becauſe God gaue another law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by which he tranſported it ouer to the Leuites. But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preuents this reply, when he ſaith that the tithes were payd to the Leuites for a time, becauſe they liued not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: but that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> kept the right for euer which God had once giuen him, becauſe he was immortall.</p>

And that is it which himſelfe ſaith, Mat. 22.42. If he be the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> how then doth <hi>Dauid</hi> call him Lord? Wee ſee now that this argument from <hi>Leui</hi> to Chriſt holds not. Moreouer, ſeeing <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> is the figure of Chriſt, what reaſon is there that he ſhould be ſet to fight (as you would ſay) againſt him? For this common principle is to bee held, That which is placed beneath, doth not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelfe againſt the principall to which it is referred. Wherfore, ſeeing the figure is leſſe than the truth, it cannot, neither ought it to bee oppoſite againſt it. For this combat ought to haue place among things of equalitie. Now the Apoſtle hath fully ſhewed by theſe fiue members, what compariſon there is betweene Chriſt and <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> And
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7791:66"/>hereby is refuted the brainſicke ſpeculation of thoſe who ſeeke the principall ſimilitude in the offering of Bread and Wine. We ſee that the Apoſtle examines all things here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully and curiouſly (as it were) one after another.
<note place="margin">Name, place, perpetuitie, tithes, and the right of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> He obſerues the name of the man, the place of his kingdome, the perpetuitie of his life, the right of tithes, and the right of bleſſing. Surely theſe things were of leſſe importance than the oblation. Shall wee ſay that the Spirit of God had forgotten himſelfe, ſo as to ſtay in theſe leſſer things, and to omit that which is the principall, and wherein the pith of the matter lay? And I doe the more wonder that ſo many of the ancient Doctors of the Church haue been ſo farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with this opinion, as to ſtand diſputing here about the oblation of the Bread &amp; Wine. Thus they ſay; Chriſt is a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec:</hi> but <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bread and wine, it followes then that the ſacrifice of bread and wine belongs to the Prieſthood of Chriſt. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle will ſpeake fully hereafter of the ancient ſacrifices: but of this new ſacrifice of bread and wine, wil he not ſpeak a word. How is it then that the Doctors of the Church came to be of this opinion? Truly euen becauſe one error drawes on another, for hauing forged a ſacrifice of the Supper of Chriſt, hauing receiued no ſuch commandement from him: &amp; ſo when they had once corrupted the ſupper by adding a ſacrifice vnto it, they then made what ſhift they could (now here, now there) to borrow ſome colours to patch vp their error withall.</p>
               <p>The application of this oblation of bread and wine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them as a thing ſeeming fit for the purpoſe: and by and by after it was receiued; but without iudgement or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For who will graunt that theſe perſonages had a more cleere ſight than the Spirit of God? and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if wee receiue that which they teach, the holie Ghoſt ſhould be condemned of vnaduiſednes, becauſe he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not a thing of ſo great conſequence, eſpecially ſeeing he handles this matter of ſet purpoſe. By this I conclude, that the ancient Fathers did forge vnto themſelues ſuch a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7791:66"/>ſacrifice as <hi>Moſes</hi> neuer thought of. For hee ſaith not that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offered bread and wine to God; but rather to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his companie. For theſe are his very words: <hi>And Melchiſedec King of Shalem brought foorth bread and wine, and he was a Priest of the most high God. Therefore hee bleſſed him, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 14.18. This firſt fact which he recites was performed as he was a King, to wit, to feed ſuch as were wearie in the way returning from the battaile. As touching the bleſſing it appertained to his office of Prieſthood. And therefore if any myſterie were in this oblation, it was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe fulfilled in Chriſt, than when he nouriſheth vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are hungrie and wearied with trauaile. Now the Papiſts deſerue to be laughed at againe and againe, who after they haue denied that there is any more bread and wine in the Maſſe after conſecration, doe yet notwithſtanding come in chanting their ſong of the ſacrifice of bread and wine.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>If therefore perfection had been by the Priesthood of the Leuits (for vnder it the law was establiſhed to the people) what needed it furthermore, that another Priest ſhould riſe after the order of Melchiſedec, and not to be called after the order of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron?</hi>

For in vaine ſhall a man ſeeke ſaluation where there is either death, or muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: and therefore thoſe who reſt in the old and ancient Prieſthood, ſhall neuer come to ſaluation. When he ſaith, <hi>thoſe that come to God,</hi> by this he ſignifies the faithfull, who doe onely enioy the ſaluation obtained by Chriſt. In the meane while he ſhewes what it is that faith ought to behold
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7791:69"/>in Chriſt the Mediatour. For it is the chiefe happines of man to be knit vnto his God, who is the welſpring of life, and of all felicitie: but all of vs are ſhut out from hauing acceſſe vnto him by our owne vnworthines. Therefore the proper office of the Mediatour is to ſuccour vs in this regard; to reach vs his hand, to bring vs into heauen. Now he alwaies alludes to the olde ſhadowes vnder the Law. For although the high Prieſt had the names of the twelue tribes vpon his ſhoulders, and that hee bare alſo the ſignes thereof conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vpon his heart, Exod. 28.12.29. yet he entred himſelf alone into the Sanctuarie, whereas the people tarried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the court. But reſting now vpon Chriſt, and hauing him our Mediatour, we enter by faith euen into heauen:
<note place="margin">No vaile lets vs from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching vnto God now, if we beleeue in Chriſt.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no vaile to hinder vs, but God with open face doth appeare vnto vs, and with an amiable countenance calles vs to come boldly and familiarly vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seeing he euer liueth, &amp;c.]</hi> Can wee ſufficiently eſteeme this pledge of Gods loue toward vs, that Chriſt now liues rather for vs, than for himſelfe? He was receiued into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleſſednes, that he might reigne in heauen: but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preacheth that it was for vs. Wherefore both the life, the kingdome,
<note place="margin">Chriſt with all that he hath, is ours.</note> and the glorie of Chriſt are appointed to our ſaluation, as to their proper end: and Chriſt hath nothing which wee may not bee bold to applie to our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: becauſe he was once giuen vs of the Father vpon this condition, that all he hath ſhould be made ours. Now the Apoſtle alſo immediatly ſhewes by the effect that Chriſt performes this office of Prieſthood, becauſe the proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Prieſt is to make interceſſion for the people, that he might obtaine fauour of God for them. Chriſt doth this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, becauſe he is riſen againe from death for this end. Therefore he iuſtly attributes vnto him the name of a Prieſt, becauſe of his office of interceſſion.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7791:70"/>required to be in a Prieſt. Now this honour agrees to none but to Chriſt. It followes then that that which was required to be in the Prieſts vnder the Law for the right exerciſing of their function, was wanting in them. We may therefore conclude that there was no perfection in the Leuiticall Prieſthood: and that of it ſelfe it was vnlawful, further than it was ſeruiceable vnto Chriſt, and was a figure or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him. For euen the very outward ornaments of the high Prieſt ſhewed this imperfection: otherwiſe to what end ſerued ſo rich and coſtly garments, wherewith God cauſed <hi>Aaron</hi> to be adorned when he was to performe the diuine ſeruice; were they not ſignes of an angelicall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellencie, farre exceeding all humane vertues?

For in that it is ſaid he is <hi>ſeparate from vs,</hi> it is not, as if he would ſhut vs out from hauing communion with him: but becauſe this excellencie is proper to him aboue vs, that he is voide of all impuritie.

In this place he toucheth but the ſumme briefly: but hereafter he will expound all the particulars at large: but one of the principall defects was, that they daily renued their ſacrifices; and indeed this was the chiefe thing in queſtion. For mine own part, I will alſo ſhortly, and briefly touch euery point. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Was it not a defect that the high Prieſt was faine to offer ſacrifice, firſt for his owne ſinnes? for how could ſuch a one appeaſe God for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe wrath and indignation did worthily threaten himſelfe? This is one reaſon then, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> why the auncient Prieſts were not ſufficient to doe away ſinnes. The other defect was, that they euery day offered diuers ſacrifices: whereby it appeared that there was no ſufficient purgation: becauſe the purgation beeing reiterated, the ſinnes and offences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. Now it is otherwiſe in Chriſt. For he hath no neede to ſacrifice for himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice abſolutely perfect.</note> becauſe he is not tainted with any ſpot of ſin: &amp; his ſacrifice was ſuch, that the only offering of it, is ſufficient to the ende of the world: for he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

For Chriſt is not ordained as a common man, but as he is the ſonne of God, not ſubiect to any infirmitie, but dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and adorned, with an high and ſoueraigne perfection.

True it is, that he alwaies holds on his purpoſe: but becauſe he contends with diuers arguments, he interlaced this admonition, that hee might alwaies keepe the readers attentiue to the ende and ſcope of his ſpeech. He hath heretofore prooued Chriſt to be the high Prieſt: now he ſtriues to prooue further that his Prieſthood is heauenly, wherby it follows, that by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that which Moſes inſtituted vnder the law is aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in regard it was earthly. Now becauſe Chriſt ſuffered in the baſeneſſe of the fleſh, and by taking vpon himſelfe the forme of a ſeruant, made himſelfe of no reputation in the world, Philip. 2.7. The Apoſtle ſends vs to his aſcenſion, by which not only the ſhame of the croſſe was ſwallowed vp, but alſo that baſe and abiect condition which he had by cloathing himſelfe with our fleſh. For we muſt eſteeme of the dignitie of Chriſt his Prieſthood, by the vertue of the holy Spirit, which was manifeſted in his reſurrection, and aſcenſion. Thus then ſtands his argument, Seeing Chriſt is aſcended to the right hand of God, to raigne triumphantly in heauen, he is not a miniſter of the earthly ſanctuarie, but of the heauenly.</p>

The ſhedding of his blood was a thing outward: but the purgation it wrought and yet worketh is a thing inward and ſpirituall. In a word, hee died on earth, but the power and efficacie of his death reached to heauen. As touching that which followeth, ſome turne it thus; Of the number of thoſe which offer gifts according to the law, &amp;c.

For his meaning is to prooue one of the two, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Chriſt is not a Prieſt, if ſo be the Prieſthood of the law remaine, becauſe it is without ſacrifice: or rather that the ſacrifices of the law doe take an end as ſoone as Chriſt ſhewes himſelfe.

                  <hi>As it was anſwered to Moſes when he was to finiſh the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.]</hi> This place is in Exod. 20.40. And the Apoſtle alleageth it to proue that the ſeruice of the law was but as a picture, to ſhadow forth that which was ſpirituall in Chriſt. God commands that all the parts of the Tabernacle ſhould be anſwerable to the chiefe paterne, which was ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mountaine. But if ſo be the forme of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle had a further end than that which was ſeene with the eye; as much then is to be ſaid of the ceremonies, and of all the Prieſthood. From whence it followes, that there was no ſtabilitie in any of all theſe things, but that we muſt ſtill come vnto that which was ſhadowed out by them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an excellent place, becauſe it containes in it three ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences worthie to be noted. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For firſt wee learne by this that the ceremonies of old were not forged by mans braine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did God meane to exerciſe his people therein as in ſports fit for little children: the Tabernacle alſo was not built in vaine, as if it ſerued to no other purpoſe but only to draw the eyes of the beholders to gaze vpon the outward magnificence of it, as if they were to ſtay in that. For the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of all theſe things were true and ſpiritual, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to frame them all according to the firſt paterne, which was heauenly. Therefore their opinion is too prophane which ſay, that the ceremonies were onely commanded to ſerue as a bridle for ſtaying the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the people, leaſt they ſhould haue gone to ſeeke out ſtrange ceremonies among the Gentiles. This indeede is ſomething which they ſay, but not all. For they leaue out that which is of much more importance: to wit, that they were exerciſes to hold the people in the faith of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. Yet notwithſtanding it is not needfull that we ſhould be ouer curious, ſo as to ſeeke out ſome high or profound myſterie in euery pinne, and in euery ſmall piece of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, as <hi>Heſichius,</hi> and the greater part of the ancient authors, who haue trauailed too curiouſly in this behalfe: for whileſt they goe about ſubtilly to diuine in things to them vnknowne, they haue failed very blockiſhly, and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7791:73"/>themſelues ridiculous bablers. So then we muſt keepe a meane herein: which wee ſhall doe when wee deſire to know no more than that which is reuealed to vs in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we are here taught, that all ſeruices which men haue forged after their owne minde, and without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God are falſe and corrupt. For ſeeing God commands that all things ſhould be framed according to the rule and paterne: it is not lawfull to make any thing els, or contrarie vnto it. For theſe two manners of ſpeech (<hi>See that thou make all things according to the paterne:</hi> and, Take heede thou make nothing more than the paterne) are in weight one,
<note place="margin">VVe muſt not goe an haires bredth from Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, in things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> as much as the other. Wherefore, in requiring ſtreightly that we keepe the rule which he hath giuen vs, he therewithall forbids vs to turne aſide an haires bredth from it. By this meanes all ſeruices deuiſed by men fall flat to the ground, and thoſe which ſome call Sacraments, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding were neuer ordained of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we may learne from hence that there are no true ſignes and Sacraments in religion, but thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Chriſt. But we are withall to take great heede that whileſt we endeuour to appropriate and to make our inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to agree to Chriſt, that we doe not transfigure him as the Papiſts doe, that hee ſhould bee no more like himſelfe. For we haue no authoritie to inuent what wee thinke to be good, but it only belongs to God to ſhew what we ought to doe. For it is ſaid, <hi>according to the paterne</hi> which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee.</p>

Both the one and the other were neceſſarie, becauſe it was needfull that the Iewes ſhould be turned from the ſuperſtitious obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ceremonies, which were ſo many impediments to hinder them from going directly to the pure and ſimple truth of the Goſpell. Now the Apoſtle ſaith that it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7791:73"/>that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhould giue place to Chriſt, as to the more excellent: becauſe the Goſpel is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent couenant than the law, and the death of Chriſt much more noble than the ſacrifices of the law. But that which he addes is not without ſome difficultie; to wit, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> that the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpel <hi>was eſtabliſhed vpon better promiſes.</hi> For it is certaine, that euen the very ſame hope of eternall life which we now haue, was ſet before the auncient Fathers which liued vnder the law.

But it may ſeeme that this agrees not very well, that he ſhould affirme that there had bin no neceſſitie to ſeek a place for a ſecond couenant, if ſo be the firſt had beene <hi>vnblameable:</hi> and that he addes withall, that the people are reprooued, ſo as for their default a remedie was giuen by the new couenant.

                  </label> But this obiection is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7791:74"/>faith. The law then is this couenant which God complaines the people brake. And to remedie this euill, he promiſeth a newe couenant; not like the firſt: the fulfilling of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie imports the aboliſhing of the old Teſtament. But it ſeemes the Apoſtle doth miſalleage this prophecie to make it ſerue his purpoſe. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> For here the queſtion is about the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ceremonies; and the Prophet ſpeaks of the whole lawe. For let it be granted that God doth write the rule of holines of life in the hearts, which yet is giuen by the voice of men, and by them put into writing, what is all this to the purpoſe in regard of ceremonies? I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the whole to a part. For we are not to doubt but the Prophet comprehends the whole miniſtrie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſaith, I haue made a couenant with you, which couenant you brake. The law indeed was clothed as it were, with ceremonies: but now the bodie being deſtroyed and dead, what vſe is there of the garments? for it is a common prouer be well enough knowne, that the appurtenance or acceſſarie is of the nature of his principall. It is no maruell then, if the ceremonies which are but hangbies (as you would ſay) of the old teſtament, with the whole miniſtrie of <hi>Moſes</hi> be aboliſhed. And it is alwaies the vſuall cuſtome of the Apoſtles, when they contend about ceremonies, to diſpute generally of the whole law. So then, although this propheſie of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſtretcheth it ſelfe further than to the ceremonies, yet notwithſtanding becauſe they are included vnder the name of the old Teſtament, the Apoſtle fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this propheſie to his preſent purpoſe.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7791:75"/>couenant which then was in force, and the newe couenant the which he gaue them hope of. Otherwiſe the prophet would haue ſaid, I will renue and eſtabliſh againe with you, the couenant which was broken by your default: but he now ſaith expreſly, that it ſhall not be like vnto it. Whereas he ſaith, that the Couenant was made in that <hi>day when he tooke them by the hand to bring them out of bondage:</hi> he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uates the crime of their reuolt, by the repetition of ſo great a benefit: although hee condemnes not the ingratitude of one generation onely: but, as thoſe which were deliuered, reuolted by and by, and their ſucceſſours likewiſe fell often into the ſame fault after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo he doth in this ſpeech chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the whole nation of diſloyaltie, and of breaking the couenant. When he ſaith he deſpiſed them, or <hi>regarded them not,</hi> he giues them to vnderſtand, that although they were once adopted to be his people, yet that ſhould profit them nothing, vnleſſe hee ſuccour them by a new remedie. The prophet hath other tearmes, according as the matter is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched together in the Hebrewe text: but that is of no great importance as touching the point now in queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> There are two principall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in this couenant. The firſt is touching the free remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes: the ſecond of the inward reformation of the hearts: there is a third, but that depends vpon the ſecond: &amp; that is the illumination of the minde with the knoweledge of God. Now there are here many things worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, that God calles vs to him in vaine, whileſt he onely ſpeaketh vnto vs by the voice of man. We muſt not denie, but that which he teacheth is right and iuſt: but yet he ſpeakes but to deafe eares; yea and albeit it may ſeeme that we vnderſtand ſomewhat, yet is it onely an outward ſound that beates the aire: for the heart ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines full of rebellion and frowardneſſe, caſting off the yoke of wholeſome doctrine. In a word, Gods word neuer entreth into the ſecret of the hearts, beeing of themſelues more hard than iron or ſtones, till he by his his Spirit doe ſoften them: not onely that, but the caſe is yet farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7791:75"/>for we haue a contrarie law, ingrauen within them,
<note place="margin">Gods word ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer takes place in our hearts, till he hath ſoftened them by his ſpirit.</note> in ſuch wiſe that multitudes of froward and wicked affections doe raigne therein, which doe daiely prouoke vs to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. In vaine it is then that God doth publiſh his law vnto vs by the voice of man, if withall he doe not write it in our hearts by his holy Spirit: that is, vnleſſe he frame vs and turne vs to his obedience. Now by this it appeares what free will is, and what vprightneſſe there is in our nature, before God haue regenerated vs. I graunt that we both will, and chooſe, and that freely, without conſtraint:
<note place="margin">Freevvill.</note> but our will is carried away euen with a furious violence to reſiſt God, and is not able in any thing to ſubiect it ſelfe to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This is the cauſe why the law brings nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and death with it, whileſt it remaines written in tables of ſtone: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, 2. Cor. 3.3. To be ſhort; then doe we receiue that which God commands with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient hearts, when he changeth and corrects the naturall peruerſitie of them by the worke of his Spirit: otherwiſe he ſhall finde in vs nothing but corrupt affections, and a heart wholy inclined to euill. For this ſentence of God is cleare and euident, that a new couenant muſt be made, by which God ingraues his lawes in our hearts, becauſe otherwiſe it ſhall be altogether fruitleſſe and vnprofitable vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond article is as touching the <hi>free remiſſion of ſins.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Although they haue ſinned, ſaith the Lord,

                  </note> yet will I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding pardon their ſinnes. This alſo is a very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie article. For God neuer ſo frames and faſhions vs in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his righteouſneſſe, but there ſtill remaines in vs many wicked and corrupt affections of the fleſh: yea and the corruption of our nature is regenerate but onely in part: for euery hand-while we feele wicked luſts, and naughtie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to boyle in vs. And from thence iſſueth that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate where of S. <hi>Paul</hi> complaines, Rom. 7.23. where he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of himſelfe, in the perſon of all the faithfull, that he ſaw another law in his members, rebelling againſt the law of his minde, ſo that he obeyed not God as he ought to haue done, but failed therein many waies. What good or holy
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7791:76"/>deſire then ſoeuer it be which wee haue to liue religiouſly, yet we ſhall be alwaies guiltie before God of eternal death, becauſe our conuerſation is alwaies farre off from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the law. There is no ſtabilitie in the couenant then in regard of vs, vnleſſe God doe freely forgiue vs our ſinnes. But this is a ſpeciall priuiledge belonging onely to the faithfull, who haue imbraced the couenant offered them in Chriſt: that is to ſay, to bee aſſured that God fauoureth them, and that the ſinnes to which they are ſubiect hurts them not, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> becauſe they haue a promiſe of pardon. Neither is this promiſed them for a day only, but euen to the end of their life: ſo that their reconciliation with God worketh and hath his efficacie continually. For this grace extends it ſelf throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole kingdom of Chriſt: which S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth ſufficiently ſhew 2.

For this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, <hi>and I will be their God,</hi> imports ſo much. For he is not the God of the dead, neither receiues he vs vnder his ſafegard, but to make vs partakers of his righteouſnes, and of life:

For although the Iſraelites occupied the firſt place, and were the right and lawfull heires of the couenant: yet their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue hinders not vs to haue our portion in it. So that the wider and larger the kingdome of Chriſt ſpreads, ſo far hath this couenant of ſaluation his efficacie.

Chriſt hath this in common with him, that he onely is put into the dignitie and office of the high Prieſt. But yet there is a difference, that Chriſt is come vpon this, and hath brought with him eternall benefits, which cauſeth that his Prieſthood is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7791:79"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the ancient Prieſt, &amp; ours who is Chriſt, had this in common, that both of them entred into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all by the Sanctuarie: but in this they differ, that Chriſt onely is entred into heauen, by the temple of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Whereas the moſt holy place was open to the high Prieſt onely once a yeere, to make the purgation of ſinnes, this did alreadie ſomewhat darkly repreſent the onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſt. This <hi>once</hi> then is common to them both: but to the earthly Prieſt it was yeerely: and to the heauenly Prieſt eternally vntil the conſummation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring of blood is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the blood: becauſe Chriſt offred not vp the blood of beaſts, but his owne blood. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Satisfaction was common to them both, but the ſatisfaction of the law was reiterated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere, becauſe it was without efficacie: contrariwiſe, the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, hath his efficacie alwaies, and is the cauſe of eternall ſaluation. Thus there is ſcarcely a word which hath not his weight. Whereas others haue turned it, <hi>Christ an high Prieſt preſent, &amp;c.</hi> do not rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Apoſtles meaning.

               <p>By this clauſe, <hi>of good things to come,</hi> are ſignified eternall good things.

For as the Leuiticall Prieſts in former time entred into the moſt holy place by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sanctuarie, ſo Chriſt is entred into the heauenly glorie by his bodie: becauſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7791:80"/> ordained to bring men to Chriſt: (the eternall ſaluation of the ſoule onely depending on him) ſo the ſacrifices were true teſtimonies of this ſaluation. What meanes the Apoſtle then, when hee mentioneth the purification of the fleſh? Surely he ſpeakes of the figuratiue or ſacramentall purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this ſenſe; If the blood of beaſts were a true witnes of purgation,
<note place="margin">The blood of beasts purified ſacramentally: but Chriſts blood doth it really.</note> ſo as it ſanctified, and did purifie ſacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: how much more ſhall Chriſt himſelfe who is the truth, I ſay not beare witnes of purgation by outward ceremonie, but ſhall indeede giue it to the conſciences? And therefore it is an argument from the ſignes to the thing ſignified: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the effect of the thing farre excelleth the truth of the ſignes.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Now he ſhewes very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from whence the death of Chriſt takes his dignitie, to wit, from the vertue of the Spirit, and not from the outward act. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For Chriſt indeed ſuffered as hee was man: but this his death is healthfull for vs, by reaſon of the efficacie which came from the Spirit. For the ſacrifice of our eternall purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more than a humane worke. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And for this cauſe he calleth <hi>the eternall Spirit,</hi> to the end wee might know, that the reconciliation which he made was eternall. When hee ſaith <hi>without ſpot,</hi> although he alludes to the ſacrifices of the law, where the beaſts that were ſacrificed ought to bee free from imperfection or fault: yet notwithſtanding his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that Chriſt onely is the proper and lawfull ſacrifice to appeaſe God. For ſome fault might alwaies be found in the others. And for that cauſe he ſaid before that the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the law was not ſo perfect, but ſome fault was to be found therewith.
<note place="margin">Chriſts ſacrifice abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in al points</note> But this perfection which is in Chriſt, hath nothing in it which is not full in all points.</p>
               <p>By <hi>dead workes,</hi> he vnderſtands thoſe works which beget death, or which are fruites of death. For euen as the life of the ſoule conſiſts in the coniunction that wee haue with God; ſo thoſe who are eſtranged from him by ſinne, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rightly eſteemed dead. Now wee are to note the end of this purgation: to wit, <hi>that we ſhould ſerue the liuing God.</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:7791:80"/>For although we be waſhed by Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Nothing vve doe is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in Gods ſight, till we be purged by the blood of Chriſt.</note> yet it is not that wee ſhould by and by goe wallow our ſelues afreſh in our dung: but that our puritie might ſerue to the glorie of God. Moreouer, the Apoſtle hereby teacheth vs, that nothing proceedeth from vs which can be acceptable vnto God, till we be purged by the blood of Chriſt. For ſeeing wee are all of vs enemies of God, before wee be reconciled, he muſt in his iuſtice hate all our workes. The beginning therefore of the true and lawfull ſeruice of God, is reconciliation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſeeing there is no work of ours ſo pure and cleane without ſpot, that of it ſelfe can bee acceptable and well pleaſing vnto God: therefore it is neceſſarie that the <hi>blood of Christ</hi> ſhould come betweene to waſh away all the ſpots that are in them. Thus wee muſt note the ſeemly antitheſis which he makes betweene the <hi>liuing God; and dead workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore he is the Mediatour of the new Testament,</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>15</label> &amp;c.] He concludes that we are not now to looke for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſt, becauſe Chriſt fully and abſolutely performes this office vnder the new Teſtament. For he attributes not this honour of the Mediatourſhip to Chriſt, to the end that others ſhould ioyne with him in that office: but hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and with forcible arguments maintaines, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were depoſed, when the office was once giuen to Chriſt. But to confirme this more fully, he alſo recites how Chriſt obtained this office of a Mediatour: to wit, <hi>through death, which was for the tranſgreſſion.</hi> If this be found in Chriſt alone, and is not to be found in any other, it followes that he is the true and onely Mediatour. He alſo toucheth the vertue &amp; efficacie of his death, when he ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the price was paid for ſinnes, which could not be purged by the blood of beaſts vnder the <hi>former Testament.</hi> By which words hee would haue the Iewes to paſſe from the law to Ieſus Chriſt. For if the weaknes of the law is ſo great, that all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which it giueth to waſh away ſinnes, doe not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which they ſignifie: what is hee that would reſt himſelfe in them, as in a ſure hauen? This onely point, I ſay, ought to be a ſufficient ſpurre vnto them to deſire a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7791:81"/>of the law: becauſe whileſt they reſt ſtill in that, it cannot be auoided but they muſt fal into a perpetual anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conſcience.

In a word, they had no better meanes to aſſure them of the remiſſion of their ſinnes, than in looking vnto Chriſt. Now if the only beholding of Chriſt did waſh away their ſinnes, they could neuer be deliuered from them, if they ſhould ſtill haue reſted in the law. True it is that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 32.1. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne: but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ioyfull tidings of this bleſſednes, it was neceſſarie for him to turne his eyes from the law, and to faſten them vpon Chriſt.

                  <hi>They which were called receiued the promiſe,</hi> &amp;c.] The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God hath made with vs tends to this end, that wee being adopted of him for his children, are at the laſt made inheritors of eternall life. The Apoſtle ſhewes that we obtaine ſo great a benefit by the meanes of Chriſt: from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7791:81"/>whence it appeares that the accompliſhment of this his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant is in him.

It is very ſure that life was promiſed in old time to the Fathers, and the ſame which is now at this day, was from the beginning the heritage of the children of God: but wee enter not into the poſſeſſion of it, vnleſſe the blood of Chriſt doe goe before. He makes expreſſe mention of thoſe which <hi>are called:</hi> to the end hee might moue the Iewes with the greater care, who were partakers of this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For it is a ſpeciall fauour of God when the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt is giuen vs: and therefore ſo much the more ought wee to take heede, that in deſpiſing ſo ineſtimable a treaſure, our ſpirits doe not wander elſewhere. Some take this word <hi>called</hi> here, for elected: but vnfitly, as I thinke. For the Apoſtle teacheth here the very ſame thing that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth Rom. 3.25. to wit, that righteouſnes and ſaluation was obtained for vs by the blood of Chriſt, but we receiue it by faith.</p>

But becauſe the Greeke word <hi>Diathece,</hi> hath theſe two ſignifications, to wit, of the Couenant, and of the Teſtament: for this cauſe the Apoſtle alluding to the ſecond ſignification, affirmeth that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes could not otherwiſe bee of any weight or ſtabilitie, vnleſſe they had been ſealed by the death of Chriſt. Which he proues by the common right of Teſtaments: the effect of which is deferred till the death of the Teſtator. Although it may yet ſeeme that the Apoſtle grounds his ſpeech vpon too weake a reaſon: ſo as that which he ſaith may eaſily be refuted. For God made no Teſtament vnder the law, but made a Couenant with the ancient people. And thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle could not gather from the thing it ſelfe, neither yet
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7791:82"/>from the name, that the death of Chriſt was neceſſarie. For if he would inferre by the matter it ſelfe, that it was needful Chriſt ſhould die, becauſe the Teſtament is not ratified, till the death of the Teſtator come betweene: ſome might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reply, that <hi>Berith</hi> (which word <hi>Moſes</hi> vſeth here and there to this purpoſe) is a Couenant made betweene the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: ſo as wee cannot thinke otherwiſe of the matter. As touching the <hi>name,</hi> hee ſimply alludes, as I haue ſaid, to the ſignification of the Greeke word <hi>Diathece,</hi> which hath two ſignifications: and therefore hee chiefly inſiſts vpon the <hi>thing.</hi> Neither is this repugnant to that which ſome might ſay, that it was a couenant which God made with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For this couenant was like a Teſtament, becauſe it was eſtabliſhed, and confirmed by blood. This principle then muſt be retained, that God neuer vſed ſignes at randon, nor without cauſe. Now ſo it is that God in confirming of the Couenant intermingled blood therewithall. It follows then that it was not a contract betweene the liuing (as they ſay) but ſuch a contract as required death to come betweene. For a Teſtament hath this condition proper vnto it, that it begins to take effect after death. If we then conſider that the Apoſtle conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds rather about the ſubſtance, than the name: moreouer if we come to weigh with our ſelues that he takes that (which I haue ſaid) for a thing without controuerſie, to wit, that God hath ordained nothing idly or in vaine; there will be no great difficultie. <label type="milestone">

               <p>The <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> makes mention, was once a figure of this. Although there bee more to be vnderſtood in theſe words, than <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſeth.

<note place="margin">Exod. 24.5.6.7</note> to the end the people might enter into an obligation vnto God, anſwering to the ſolemne coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant pronounced by the mouth of <hi>Moſes.</hi> As touching the reſt, it ſeemes to me the Apoſtle hath intermingled diuers purgations, of which wee may giue the ſame reaſon. And ſurely no inconuenience is in it; ſeeing he handles a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall point touching the purgation of the olde Teſtament, which was made by blood. Now whereas they made a <hi>ſprinkle of hyſope, and of purple wooll,</hi> we neede not doubt but they repreſented the myſticall ſprinkling which is made by the holy Spirit.
<note place="margin">The vertue of Hyſope.</note> We know that Hyſope hath a ſingular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to purge and to digeſt ſuperfluous humours: ſo Chriſt vſeth his ſpirit as a water-ſprinkle to ſprinkle vs with his blood, when as hee giueth a liuely feeling of repentance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when he conſumes the peruerſe affections of our fleſh, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and when he dieth vs with the rich and noble colour of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For we muſt not imagine that God ordained theſe things for nothing. <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo in the 51.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>22</label> &amp;c.] When he ſaith <hi>almost,</hi> it ſeemes his meaning is to ſhew that there are ſome other things which are purged after another manner. And
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7791:84"/>indeed they often vſed waſhings with water both to clenſe themſelues withall, as alſo other impure things. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding euen this water had no vertue to clenſe but as they had it from the ſacrifices: ſo as the Apoſtle ſaith true, when for a concluſion he ſets downe, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion.</hi> Wherefore impuritie was imputed vntill ſuch time as it was clenſed by ſacrifice. And as out of Chriſt there is neither puritie nor ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo without blood nothing could be pure nor healthfull: for Chriſt muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſeparated from the ſacrifice of his death. But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning was ſimply to ſay, that this ſigne was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alwaies in a manner. And if it fell out that the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not ſometimes ſo made, yet notwithſtanding it depended vpon the blood, ſeeing all the ceremonies did as you would ſay borrow their vertue from this generall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Neither are we to imagine that euery particular man among the people was ſprinkled: (for if it had bin ſo, how could ſo little a portion of blood haue ſatisfied ſo great a multitude?) notwithſtanding the purgation came to all. So then this word <hi>almoſt,</hi> is as much as if it had been ſaid, The vſe of this ceremonie was very frequent, ſo as it was very ſeldome left out in ordinarie purgations. For whereas <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> thinkes that by this word is ſignified an improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, becauſe all was there in figures onely, it is nothing neere the Apoſtles meaning. <hi>There is no remiſſion.</hi> By this meanes men were ſhut out from before the face of God: for in as much as hee is iuſtly angrie with them all, they could not promiſe themſelues to finde any fauour with him, till he were appeaſed.
<note place="margin">There is but one meanes to procure reconci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liation: which is the blood of Chriſt.</note> Now there was but one meane whereby to appeaſe him: to wit, by the ſatisfaction which was made by blood.

                  </label> it is not required in the perſon or office of a Prieſt to be alwaies in the continuall act of offring ſacrifice. For in the law it ſelfe there was euery yeere certaine daies ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the chiefeſt ſacrifices: and the ſacrifices which were ordinarily performed, had their limits to the morning, and the euening. Now ſeeing this only ſacrifice that Chriſt once offered hath alwaies his ſtrength and vertue, yea and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall as touching the efficacie thereof, wee muſt not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if his eternall Prieſthood be eſtabliſhed in the vertue of this ſacrifice, which neuer periſheth, or hath an end. And here againe he ſhewes what difference there is, and in what things, betweene Chriſt and the Leuiticall Prieſthood. As touching the Sanctuarie, he hath ſpoken heretofore: but he notes a difference in the kinde of ſacrifice, becauſe Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and not a beaſt. And then hee notes another difference, to wit, that <hi>he did not often offer</hi> this ſacrifice, as vnder the law, where they often, yea and almoſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiterated their ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For then he must haue often ſuffered,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>26</label> &amp;c.] He ſheweth how abſurd and vnreaſonable a thing it ſhould be, if wee content not our ſelues with the onely ſacrifice of Chriſt. For from thence he concludes, that he muſt then haue often ſuffered, becauſe death is alwaies ioyned with the ſacrifice. Now there is no reaſon at all to grant this latter: it followes then that the vertue of this onely ſacrifice is eternall, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe vnto all times. He ſaith, <hi>ſince the foundation of the world,</hi> becauſe that in all times ſince the beginning there haue bin ſinnes which haue had neede of purgation. If then the ſacrifice of Chriſt had not been effectuall from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<note place="margin">Chriſts ſacrifice effectuall from the beginning.</note> none of the Fathers had obtained ſaluation. For ſeeing that of themſelues they were culpable before God,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7791:85"/>and deſerued his wrath, they had bin deſtitute of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of redemption, and had had no meanes to eſcape the iudgement ſeate of God, vnles Chriſt by enduring of death once, had ſuffered from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, for the obtaining of Gods fauour for men. And therefore let vs ſatisfie our ſelues with this onely ſacrifice, vnleſſe peraduenture wee expect many deaths of Chriſt. By this it alſo euidently appeares how friuolous that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Papiſts is,
<note place="margin">The friuolous diſtinction of the Papiſts, touching the bloodie and vnbloodie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> in which ſubtilty they ſo much pleaſe themſelues, when they ſay that the offring vp of Chriſt vpon the croſſe was bloodie; but the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which they forge to be offered vp euery day, is without blood. For if this ſuttle ſhift may haue place, the Spirit of God ſhall be blamed of vnadurſednes, becauſe he remembred not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concerning this. For the Apoſtle takes it for a thing out of queſtion, that there is no ſacrifice without death. I paſſe not, that the ancient Doctors haue ſpoken thus: for it is not in the power of men to forge what ſacrifices they liſt. This principle of the holy Ghoſt remaines ſure, that <hi>ſins are not purged by ſacrifices,</hi> vnleſſe there be <hi>effuſion of blood.</hi> Therefore it is an inuention of the diuell, to hold that Chriſt ſhould be often offered. <hi>But now in the end of the world he appeared once, &amp;c.</hi> He calles <hi>the end of the world,</hi> that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calles the fulnes of time, Gal. 4: for the time was then expired, which the Lord had ordained by his eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. And by this meanes the curioſities of men are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to the end they ſhould not preſume to enquire; ſome, why it came not ſooner; others, why rather then, than at another time: for we ought to reſt and ſtay our ſelues in the ſecret counſell of God, who beſt knowes to giue a reaſon of it, although it be not manifeſted to vs. To bee ſhort, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſignifies that the death of Chriſt fell out iuſt at that time wherein his Father ſent him into the world for that purpoſe: who as he hath in his owne power the lawfull go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of all things, ſo hath he the times alſo, ſeeing hee ordreth them by an admirable wiſedome, howſoeuer it bee often hidden from vs. Moreouer, this conſummation or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7791:86"/>end, is oppoſed to the imperfection of the time paſt: for God did ſo keepe the people of the old Teſtament in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that one might eaſily iudge it was not yet come to a firme and ſetled eſtate. For this cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth in the 1. Cor. 10.11. that the ends of the world are come vpon vs, ſignifying therby that the kingdom of Chriſt hath brought the fulfilling of all things. But if the fulnes of time were then when Chriſt appeared to purge our ſinnes, they doe him great iniurie and outrage who would that his ſacrifice ſhould be renued; as if all things were not fulfilled at his death. He then appeared once: for if the thing ſhould bee done the ſecond, or the third time, there ſhould be imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the firſt oblation: which were a thing repugnant to perfection. <hi>For the destruction of ſinne, by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> This agreeth with the prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> by which the end of the ſacrifices was foretolde, after the promiſe made of the ſealing vp, and aboliſhing of ſins. For to what end ſhould purgations ſerue after the deſtruction of ſinnes? Now this <hi>destruction</hi> conſiſts in this, that ſinnes are no more imputed to thoſe who haue their refuge to the ſacrifice of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Hovv ſinne is ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> for although neceſſitie be laid vpon vs to aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don euery day, becauſe we do euery day prouoke the wrath of God afreſh againſt vs, notwithſtanding for as much as wee are alwaies reconciled to God by the pledge of Chriſt his onely death, and not otherwiſe: therefore it is rightly ſaid that ſinne is <hi>destroyed</hi> by it.</p>

                  <hi>He ſhall appeare the ſecond time without ſinne.</hi> The Apoſtle ſtill aimes at this marke, to wit, that we ſhould not vexe our ſelues with vaine and froward deſires after new purgations, becauſe the death of Chriſt alone, is ſufficient for vs. And therefore he ſaith, that he <hi>once</hi> appeared with ſacrifice to purge away ſinnes, and that by his ſecond appearing he ſhall openly manifeſt what efficacie his death hath had, ſo as ſinne ſhall no more haue power to hurt. <hi>To aboliſh ſinnes,</hi> that is, by his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to deliuer thoſe from the fault, and from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which haue ſinned. He ſaith <hi>many,</hi> for all: as in Rom. 5.15. True it is that Chriſts death profits not all: but this comes to paſſe, becauſe their incredulitie hindreth them. But it were in vaine to contend hereabouts in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle diſputes not whether the death of Chriſt profits a few or many: but his plaine meaning is, that hee died for others, and not for himſelfe. Wherefore he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>many,</hi> to one onely.</p>
               <p>But what meanes he by theſe words, that Chriſt ſhall <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare without ſinne?</hi> By the word <hi>ſinne,</hi> ſome vnderſtand the purgation or ſacrifice purging ſin: as Rom. 8.3. and 2. Cor. 5.21. and in many other places of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he meant ſomething more ſpeciall, to wit, that when Chriſt ſhall come hee ſhall manifeſt how true it is that hee hath aboliſhed ſinnes: ſo as there ſhall be no more need of any other ſacrifice to appeaſe God. As if hee ſhould ſay, when wee ſhall come before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, then wee ſhall feele that nothing was wanting in his death. To which that alſo is to be referred which he addes by and by after, <hi>To ſaluation to thoſe which looke for him:</hi> Others doe conſtrue it otherwiſe on this manner; To thoſe that looke for him for ſaluation. But I thinke the other ſenſe is more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7791:87"/>proper. For his meaning is, that thoſe ſhall feele a full ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation from Chriſt, who with quiet minds doe reſt vpon it. For this <hi>looking for,</hi> is to be referred to the circumſtance of the preſent matter. True it is that the Scripture in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attributes this in common to all the faithfull; that they waite for the comming of the Lord, to the end that by it they may be diſcerned from the vnbeleeuers; to whom alſo the onely mention of this his comming is fearefull as ſoone as they heare tell of it: but becauſe the Apoſtle contends now that we ought to reſt our ſelues ſatisfied in the onely ſacrifice of Chriſt, he calles it <hi>the looking for of Christ,</hi> when being contented with this onely redemption, we luſt not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new remedies or helps.</p>

But the Apoſtle ſaith here, they were like rude draughts, which are but the ſhadows of the liuely painting. For painters are wont to drawe that which they purpoſe to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7791:87"/>counterfeit or repreſent with a cole,
<note place="margin">A ſimilitude ſetting forth the difference between the law and the Goſpell.</note> before they ſet on the liuely colours with the penſill. The Apoſtle then puts this difference betweene the law and the Goſpell: to wit, that that which at this day is drawne and painted with freſh and liuely colours, was onely ſhadowed out vnder the law by a rude or groſſe draught. Thus he yet againe confirmes that which he ſaid before, to wit, that the law was no vaine thing, neither the ceremonies thereof vnprofitable. For although it had not the perfect image of heauenly things, as if the workeman had put his laſt indeauour to it, yet euen this rough draught was greatly profitable to the Auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: albeit our condition be now much better. And let vs obſerue, that euen thoſe things which are now ſet before our eyes, were ſhewed to them a farre off.
<note place="margin">The Iewes and Gentiles haue but one means of ſaluation for the ſubſtance: the diuerſitie ſtands onely in the manner of reuelation.</note> And therefore both we, and they haue the ſame Chriſt, the ſame righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the ſame ſanctification, and the ſame ſaluation: there is no difference or diuerſitie, but in the manner of ſetting them forth. I thinke by theſe words <hi>of good things to come,</hi> he meanes eternall good things. I confeſſe indeede that the kingdome of Chriſt which we now enioy, was long agoe foretold to come: but the words of the Apoſtle ſignifie that we haue the liuely pourtraiture of good things to come. He meanes then that ſample and ſpirituall patterne, the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying whereof is deferred vntill the day of the reſurrection, and to the world to come. And yet I doe againe confeſſe that theſe good things began to be reuealed from the beginning of Chriſt his kingdome: but the queſtion is now, that the <hi>good things to come</hi> in this place are not onely ſo called in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the old Teſtament, but becauſe we alſo doe yet hope and waite for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which they offered yeere by yeere continually:]</hi> He ſpeakes chiefely of the yeerely ſacrifice, whereof mention is made Leuit. 16. although in naming one kind, he comprehends the whole. Thus he reaſoneth then, Where there is no more conſcience and remorſe for ſinne, there alſo is no more need of oblations. Now vnder the Law they offered one and the ſame offering often. Therefore it followes that God
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7791:88"/>was not ſatisfied; the condemnation taken away, neither the conſciences of men quieted: for if it had been otherwiſe, they would then haue ceaſed to offer any more ſacrifices. Moreouer, we are diligently to obſerue, that he ſaith <hi>with the ſame ſacrifices,</hi> which had the like reaſon. For they were eſteemed rather by the ſame ordinance of God, than of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers beaſts. And this argument alone is ſufficient of it ſelfe to refute the ſubtiltie of the Papiſts, by which they thinke they finely auoyde the abſurditie of excuſing the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. For when we tell them it is ſuperfluous to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſacrifice, ſeeing that which Chriſt hath once offered retaines his vertue for euer; they by and by reply, the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice offered in the Maſſe, is not another, but the ſame. This is their ſolution. But how doth the Apoſtle here contradict it? Thus, the ſacrifice which is offered and many times reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: although it be <hi>the ſame,</hi> is not effectuall, nor ſufficient for the purgation of ſinnes.
<note place="margin">An obiection of the Papiſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſay they offer not an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacrifice, but the ſame vvhich Christ offered.</note> Let the Papiſts now crie a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times if they will, that the ſacrifice which they offer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, is the ſame ſacrifice which Chriſt hath once made vpon the Croſſe, and none other: I will alwaies maintaine againſt them by the mouth of the Apoſtle, that if the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt had this vertue to appeaſe God, then this his ſacrifice hath not onely put an end to other oblations, but alſo that it is vnlawfull to reiterate the ſame: whereby we ſee, that it is an execrable ſacriledge, to offer Chriſt in the Maſſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>3</label> &amp;c.] Seeing the Goſpell is the ambaſſage of our reconciliation with God, it is yet neceſſarie that the remembrance againe of ſinnes ſhould be made alwaies amongſt vs euen at this day: but the Apoſtle ſignifieth that when ſinnes are <hi>remembred,</hi> it is to the end the condemnation of them might be taken away, by the remedie of the ſacrifice preſently offered: he meanes not euery remembrance then, but that which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſuch a confeſſion of faultes, and of the condemnation which they deſerue before God, that it ſhould be needfull to haue a ſacrifice, to procure a remedie. Such is the ſacrifice of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7791:88"/>the Maſſe amongſt the Papiſts. For they forge that the grace of the death of Chriſt is there applied vnto vs, that our ſins might be done away. But if the Apoſtle rightly collecteth that the ſacrifices of the law were weake, becauſe they were reiterated euery yeere to obtaine pardon: truly then a man may gather by the ſame reaſon that the ſacrifice of the death of Chriſt was weake, if it muſt bee celebrated euery day, to the end the vertue of it may be applied vnto vs. Let them paint out their Maſſe then with what colours ſoeuer they will, yet ſhall they not bee able to auoide this fault, to wit, that in the ſame their ſacrifice, they blaſpheme, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wicked outrage vnto Chriſt.</p>

True it is, the Iewes had therein a ſigne, and pledge of their true purgation, but it was another way: to wit, becauſe the blood of a calfe ſignified the blood of Chriſt. But here the Apoſtle diſputes of the value of the blood of beaſts in it ſelfe: and therfore he doth rightly take away from them the vertue of purging. We are here then to vnderſtand a cloſe oppoſition, which is not expreſſed: as if hee had ſaid, It is no marueile if the ancient ſacrifices were weake and feeble, ſo as there was neceſſitie they ſhould bee offered without ceaſing: for there was nothing in them but the blood of beaſts, which pearced not vnto the ſoule: but the blood of Chriſt is a farre other thing.

Pſalme, verſ. 10. Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption. For albeit God ſhould haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered <hi>Dauid</hi> from corruption as touching himſelfe, yet this was truly and onely fulfilled in Chriſt. There is great weight then in this ſpeech, when he promiſeth <hi>that he will do the will of God,</hi> for he leaues no place for the ſacrifices.

For the Apoſtles were not ſo ſcrupulous to recite the very words; prouided that they alwaies kept themſelues from abuſing the Scriptures falſely to their own aduantage.

This extends it ſelfe to all the members of Chriſt. For the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is generall, where he ſaith, This is the will of God, euen your ſanctification, that euery one of you ſhould abſtaine from vncleanneſſe. 1. Theſſ. 4.3. But becauſe the example of this obedience was in Chriſt farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than in any other, principally by taking vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and then in preſenting himſelfe to the death of the croſſe: for this cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied the commandement of his father, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelfe a ſacrifice; and that we by this meanes haue beene ſanctified.</p>

Heretofore hee alleaged it to another end: to wit, to ſhew that it was neceſſary the old Teſtament ſhould be aboliſhed, in regard a new was promiſed, that it might correct the weaknes of the old.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7791:91"/>heretofore there were innumerable promiſes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes in the Law, and in the Prophets; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Church ceaſed not for all that to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſtill for themſelues: and therfore remiſſion of ſinnes excludes not ſacrifices.

And yet notwithſtanding all this, the Prophet as if he ſpake of ſome new thing not yet heard of, ſaith, that there ſhall be no more remembrance of ſinnes before God, vnder the new Couenant. From this we gather, that ſinnes are now pardoned after another manner than they were in old time. But this diuerſitie conſiſts neither in the word, nor in faith, but in the ranſome of the remiſſion.</p>
               <p>God now then no more remembers ſinnes and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe the purgation hath been made for all, <hi>once.</hi> For otherwiſe the Prophet hath affirmed in vaine, that it ſhould be a benefit, and grace of the new Teſtament, That God would remember our ſinnes no more. Furthermore, ſeeing wee are come to the end of the diſputation which is here handled touching the Prieſthood of Chriſt; the readers are to be aduertiſed in few words, that the inuention of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts touching the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is no leſſe refuted in this place, than the ſacrifices of the law are hereby abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. They maintaine that their Maſſe is a ſacrifice to doe away the ſinnes both of the quicke and the dead: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle on the contrarie ſaith, that euen this ſacrifice of Chriſt ought not to be reiterated of any: neither doth he only ſay that this ſacrifice of Chriſt is <hi>one,</hi> but alſo that it was offered <hi>once.</hi> Adde hereunto that he often attributes to Chriſt alone the honour of the Prieſthood, ſo as none is ſufficient or meete to offer Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelfe onely.
<note place="margin">None fit to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt but himſelfe.</note> They haue yet an euaſion, when they call it an vnbloodie ſacrifice: but the Apoſtle without exception affirmes, that to make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, death is required. Moreouer, the Papiſts haue yet another ſhift, when they replie that the Maſſe is an applying
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7791:92"/>of the onely ſacrifice once done. But the Apoſtle teacheth on the contrary, that the cauſes why the ſacrifices of the law were aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, was becauſe that in them men remembred ſinnes.

To the end then that the Iewes who were inflamed with enuie, ſhould not enter into combat againſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he exhorts them to an holy emulation: to wit, that they ſhould ſtirre vp and prouoke one another to loue.

The compoſition of the Greeke word is to be noted, which ſignifies not ſimply an aſſemblie, or a congregation, but a congregation augmented with new encreaſings. The wall being then broken downe, God aſſembled thoſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which had bin ſtrangers from the Church, to knit them vnto his children, Epheſ. 2.14. Thus the Gentiles were a new and vnwonted encreaſing of the Church. The Iewes tooke this as a great diſhonour to them, ſo as many among them reuolted from the Church; thinking they had ſufficient oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſo to doe, becauſe of ſuch a mingling of the Gentiles with them. For they could not eaſily bee perſwaded that they ought to loſe their prerogatiue. Why ſo? they thought that the right of adoption belonged to them properly and particularly. The Apoſtle then admoniſheth them that they ſhould not bee ſtirred vp to forſake the Church becauſe of this equalitie: and to the end they might not thinke that he admoniſheth them without cauſe, he giues them to wit, that it is a common vice whereof they were guiltie.

<note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene particular faults, and a generall apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie.</note> and ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall falling away, by which wee doe wholy cut our ſelues off from the grace of Chriſt. And becauſe this can befall none but thoſe who haue beene alreadie enlightened, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we ſinne willingly after we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the knowledge of the truth:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, If wee doe wittingly and willingly reiect the grace which wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Now wee may ſee well how farre off this doctrine diſagrees from the error of <hi>Nouatus:</hi> And that the Apoſtle here onely comprehends Apoſtaraes, it doth euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the deduction of the text. For it tends to ſhew, that thoſe who were once receiued into the Church, ſhould not forſake the ſame, as ſome were accuſtomed to doe. He ſaith, that there <hi>remaines now no more ſacrifice for ſinnes,</hi> for thoſe who doe thus; becauſe they willingly ſinned after they had receiued and acknowledged that truth.</p>
               <p>But yet Chriſt alwaies offereth himſelfe to poore ſinners which are fallen into ſome one kinde of ſinne or other, ſo as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7791:96"/>they neede not ſeeke any other ſacrifice to take and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their ſinnes. He ſaith then, that there remaines no more ſacrifice for them, who turne away themſelues from the death of Chriſt: which a man neuer comes to doe by one particular ſinne; but when therewithall faith is wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. Now howſoeuer this ſeueritie of God be fearefull and horrible, and is ſet forth to feare men, yet it cannot be accuſed of crueltie. For ſeeing the death of Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedie by which we are deliuered from eternall death, thoſe who endeauour as much as they can to aboliſh the ſame; with the vertue and benefit of it, doe they not deſerue that deſpaire onely ſhould be allotted for them? God doth alwaies draw them to reconciliation with him, who abide in Chriſt, they are ſprinkled with his blood, their ſinnes are alwaies blotted out by his perpetuall ſacrifice. And if it be ſo, that we muſt not ſeek ſaluation out of him, let vs not wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if all thoſe who willingly forſake him, are depriued from all hope of pardon. So much ſignifies this word <hi>no more.</hi> For the ſacrifice of Chriſt is auaileable to the faithfull, euen to the very laſt breath, although they ſinne often: and euen for this cauſe it is, that it alwaies holds his ſtrength and vigour, becauſe it cannot be auoided that they ſhould not be ſubiect to ſinne, as long as they dwell in the fleſh. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes then of them onely, who wofully abondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt, doe depriue themſelues of the benefit of his death. This member, <hi>After they haue acknowledged the truth:</hi> is put to aggrauate their ingratitude. For he who willingly and of deliberate malice quencheth the light of God kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his heart, what excuſe hat he, or can he alleadge for himſelfe before God? Wherefore, let vs learne not onely with reuerence, and a readie teachableneſſe to receiue the ſpirit of truth which is offered vs, but alſo conſtantly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in the knowledge of it, to the end this ſharpe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the contempt thereof fall not vpon vs.</p>

For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle threatens not bodily death alone, to the contemners of Chriſt, but alſo eternall damnation. For this cauſe he ſaith, that theſe haue deſerued a moſt grieuous torment. Now he ſets forth the reuolt of Chriſtians by three formes of ſpeech. For he ſaith firſt, that by this meanes, <hi>the ſonne of God is tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder foote:</hi> 2. that <hi>his blood is counted a prophane thing:</hi> 3. that <hi>they deſpite the ſpirit of grace.</hi> Now it is worſe to tread vnder feete, than to deſpiſe: and the dignitie of Chriſt is far aboue the dignitie of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And note alſo, that he doth not ſimply oppoſe the Goſpell to the law, but the perſon of Chriſt, and of the holy Ghoſt, to the perſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> onely. <hi>And counteth the blood of the Teſtament as an vnholy thing.</hi> He aggrauates this ingratitude, by making compariſon of the benefits. Queſtionleſſe it is a great villanie to prophane the blood of Chriſt, which is the matter of our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now they doe it which reuolt from the faith: for the eie of our faith lookes not vpon the bare and naked doctrine, but to the blood by which our ſaluation is eſtabliſhed. And therefore he calles it the blood of the Teſtament, becauſe the promiſes thereof are then ratified and confirmed vnto vs, when this pledge of our redemption is added.</p>
               <p>But he ſhewes what the meane of this ratification is,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7791:97"/>when he ſaith, <hi>by which we are ſanctified:</hi> becauſe the blood which Chriſt ſhed ſhould nothing profit vs, if we were not ſprinkled therewithall by the holy Ghoſt. From thence comes both our purgation, and holineſſe. Notwithſtanding he alludes to the auncient manner of ſprinkling, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothing at all to true ſanctification,
<note place="margin">Foure effects which the holy Ghoſt works in vs.</note> but was only a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or figure of it. <hi>The ſpirit of grace.</hi> He calles it the ſpirit of grace, becauſe of the effect, for as much as by him and his vertue, we inioy that grace which is offered vs in Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For it is he that illuminates our vnderſtandings by faith; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which ſeales vp our adoption in our hearts; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which regenerates vs into newneſſe of life; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which ingrafts vs into the body of Chriſt, to the ende hee may liue in vs, and wee in him. He is rightly then called the ſpirit of grace, ſeeing by him Chriſt with all his benefits is made ours. Now it is too great and wicked an impietie, to deſpite him, who beſtows vpon vs ſo many, and ſo excellent benefits. From this we may gather, that all thoſe who willingly doe cauſe the ſpirit of God to become vnprofitable vnto them, which once they receiued; doe thereby reuile and deſpite him. Therefore wee are not to wonder if God doe ſo ſeuerely puniſh ſuch ſacriledges: we muſt not maruell if he ſtoppe his eares to thoſe which haue trode vnder foote Chriſt the Mediatour, who only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines for vs that which we neede: wee muſt not wonder if he ſhut vp the way of ſaluation to thoſe who haue repulſed their only leader, which is the holy Ghoſt.</p>

Now to the ende the conſolation might haue the greater waight and authoritie, he alleadgeth the teſtimonie of the Prophet Abacuk, chap. 2.4. But in regard he followed the Greeke tranſlation,

The Prophet hauing ſpoken of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible diſcomfiture of his nation, and beeing feared with his owne propheſie, could not ſee what way in the world to take, but gets himſelfe as it were out of this world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke himſelfe to his watch tower.

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe men are naturally importunate, and ſo haſtie in their affections, that they euermore thinke that God is too ſlowe, what haſte ſoeuer hee maketh; for this cauſe hee ſaith, that the promiſe ſhall come, and ſhall not tarrie.

He alleadged the teſtimonie of Habacuck, who ſaith that the Iuſt ſhall liue by faith: now he ſhewes what remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; to wit, That faith can no more be ſeparate from pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than from it ſelfe. Thus ſtands the order of the words then, We ſhall neuer attaine to the end of our ſaluation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we be furniſhed with patience. For the Prophet affirms that the iuſt ſhall liue by faith. Now faith calles vs to things very farre off from vs, which wee doe not as yet inioy: it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7791:100"/>then comprehends patience in it ſelfe. Thus then this propoſition, <hi>That faith is a foundation,</hi> ſerues as the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of the ſyllogiſme: whereby alſo it appeares that they much deceiue themſelues, who thinke this place to be a full definition of faith. For the Apoſtle ſpeakes not here of the whole nature of faith, but hee made choice of a part fitting his purpoſe; to wit, that faith is alwaies ioined with patience. Let vs now come to the words. He calles it <hi>ſubſiſtance, or ground of things hoped for.</hi> It is euident that we hope not for that which we haue in our hands, but for thoſe things which are yet hidden from our ſenſes, or at leaſt wiſe, the inioying whereof is deferred to another time. The Apoſtle then now teacheth the very ſame thing which S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, Rom. 8.24. for hauing ſaid, that we ſee not that which wee hope for, he inferreth thereupon, that we waite for it by patience. So our Apoſtle admoniſheth vs that beleeue not God ſo much in regard of things preſent, as in regard of thoſe things the expectation whereof is yet in ſuſpence. Furthermore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, which is in this ſpeech, wants not his grace. Faith, ſaith he, is the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or poſſeſſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee haue alreadie ſet ſure footing (for the Greeke word <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> which he vſeth, ſignifieth ſo much.) But of what things? of things abſent, which are ſo farre off from beeing vnder our feete, that they do very much ſurmount the reach of our vnderſtandings.</p>
               <p>There is the ſame conſideration in the ſecond member, where he calles it the <hi>euidence,</hi> or certification of things which are not ſeene. For <hi>euidence,</hi> makes things to appeare; and commonly appertaines vnto thoſe things onely which we feele and perceiue. Thus then at the firſt view theſe two things ſeeme to be contrarie, and yet notwithſtanding they agree very well in this part of the definition of faith. For the ſpirit of God diſcouereth hidden things vnto vs, whereof there can no knowledge of them come vnto vs in regard of our naturall vnderſtanding. For life eternall is promiſed vs, and yet in the meane time we die. We heare of the bleſſed reſurrection, but yet for all that we are inuironed with rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7791:101"/>We are pronounced iuſt: and yet notwithſtanding ſinne dwels ſtill in vs. We heare that we are bleſſed: but yet are we thorowly bitten with hunger and thirſt. God crieth with a lowd voyce that he will by and by aſſiſt vs: but yet it ſeemes when wee crie, that hee ſtoppeth his cares. What ſhould we now doe in theſe caſes, if we were not built vpon hope, and if in the middeſt of darknes our mindes did not lift themſelues vp farre aboue al that which is in this world, hauing the word, and the Spirit of God for our guides to go before vs? Wherefore faith is well called a ſubſiſtence of thoſe things which yet conſiſt in hope, and the euidence of things not ſeene. Whereas S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth ſometimes tranſlate the Greeke word <hi>Elenchus,</hi> which the Apoſtle here vſeth, by a noune which commeth of the verbe To ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, I doe not diſlike it: for he doth faithfully expreſſe the Apoſtles meaning. But yet I had rather call it an euidence or ſhewing, becauſe it is leſſe conſtrained.</p>

The Iewes had ſome reaſon to reuerence their anceſtors greatly: but yet a ſottiſh and vnbridled admiration of them had ſo poſſeſſed their mindes, that it hindred them much from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themſelues to bee wholy ruled vnder Chriſt his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; and this they were carried vnto, either by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſuperſtition; or both. For hearing that <hi>Abrahams</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:7791:101"/>ſeede was holy and bleſſed, they were ſo puffed vp with this title, that they looked rather vnto men, than vnto God. Moreouer, they had herewithall a ſtubborne and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate manner of imitation, becauſe they conſidered not what it was that deſerued imitation indeede in their Fathers. By this meanes they reſted in the ancient ceremonies, as if all religion and perfection of holineſſe had conſiſted in them. The Apoſtle confutes this error, and teacheth what was the chiefe and principall vertue in them, to the end their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors might vnderſtand how they might reſemble their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in truth.
<note place="margin">The Patriarkes had no other hand whereby they were knit vnto God but faith.</note> Let vs remember then that the Apoſtles ſpeciall and chiefe drift of his ſpeech is, to ſhew that all the Fathers who from the beginning were approoued of God, were no otherwiſe conioyned with him but by faith: that ſo the Iewes might know that they had no other meane to bee allowed of God, and to bee knit in an holy vnitie with their Fathers, but by faith: ſo that as ſoone as they left faith, they by and by baniſhed themſelues from the Church, and were no longer accounted <hi>Abrahams</hi> lawfull children, but baſtards.</p>

In the firſt place he ſaith, that the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> was not eſteemed for any reſpect better than his brothers, but onely becauſe it was ſanctified by faith. For in very truth the fat of the beaſts had no ſuch ſweete ſauour, that God ſhould bee appeaſed in reſpect thereof.
<note place="margin">The perſon of a man muſt be accepted, before his ſacrifice can be allowed: who is accepted of God then but he whoſe heart is purged by faith?</note> And the Scriptures doe ſhew ſufficiently for what cauſe ſacrifices were well pleaſing vnto him: for theſe are the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> and to his gifts. From whence we may eaſily gather, that his ſacrifices were accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, becauſe he himſelf pleaſed God.

<note place="margin">No vvorks are accounted for iuſt before God but thoſe that proceed from a righteous man.</note> but the workes of a righteous man. For ſee the argument of the Apoſtle; God teſtified of <hi>the gifts</hi> of <hi>Abel,</hi> by the which he obtained the praiſe of righteouſnes before him. Now this is a profitable doctrine, and ſo much the more worthie to bee noted, becauſe the truth of it cannot eaſily be perſwaded vnto vs. For when we ſee ſome brightnes to ſhine, be it in any worke whatſoeuer, wee are ſuddenly rapt vp into an admiration of it, and wee thinke God cannot iuſtly reprooue it: but hee who onely lookes to the inward puritie of the heart, reſts not at all in the outward viſors of workes. Let vs learne then that no iuſt worke can proceede from vs, till ſuch time as we be iuſtified our ſelues in the ſight of God. <hi>He being yet dead.</hi> This he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo attributes to faith, to wit, that God teſtified he had care of <hi>Abel</hi> after his death, as well as during the time of his life. For when he ſaith that he ſpake <hi>being yet dead,</hi> he ſignifies that which <hi>Moſes</hi> recites: to wit, that God was moued by his cruell death to take vengeance of it. Whereas then it is ſaid, that <hi>Abel,</hi> or his <hi>blood</hi> cried; both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are figuratiue ſpeeches. Now this was a ſingular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7791:102"/>of the loue of God towards him, that he had a care of him after he was dead. And from hence it appeares that he is of the number of the Saints of God, whoſe death was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vnto him, as it is in the 115. Pſalme, verſ. 15.</p>

For at that time impietie, and all manner of corruptions reigned euery where: if hee had died after the common manner of men, none would haue thought hee had been ſo preſented by the prouidence of God, that hee ſhould not be infected with the common contagion of the time: but in regard he was caught vp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dying, the hand of God did therein manifeſtly ſhew it ſelfe from heauen, by pulling him as it were out of the midſt of the ſire.

Now let vs remember that wee muſt beleeue this, and not content our ſelues with a bare &amp; naked opinion of it. For although the wicked, and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe ſometimes conceiue ſomething like vnto it, yet for all that they doe not therfore come vnto God, becauſe they are not ſtaied vpon a firme and ſteadfaſt faith: this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of faith, by which we obtaine fauour with God: to wit, when we are certainly perſwaded that we haue ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him.</p>
               <p>But many doe malitiouſly corrupt this ſecond member, by drawing from it the merit of workes, and the confidence of meriting.
<note place="margin">Merit of works</note> For ſee how they frame their argument: If wee be acceptable to God by faith, becauſe we beleeue him to be a rewarder of them that ſeeke him: faith then (ſay they) hath reſpect to the merit of workes.

                  </gap>e this errour,
<note place="margin">The meanes how to ſeeke God.</note> is to conſider of the meanes by which we ſeeke God. For we muſt not bee ſo fooliſh to thinke wee ſeeke God, when wee erre from the right way of ſeeking him. Now the ſcripture aſſigneth this to be the meane and way to ſeeke God: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, that a man be humbled in himſelfe, and touched to the quicke by feeling himſelfe guiltie of eternall death before God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vtterly deſpairing of any helpe in himſelfe: ſecondly, that ſuch a one haue his refuge vnto Chriſt, as to the onely hauen of his ſaluation: for it is certain we cannot find in any place of ſcripture that we muſt bring any merit of workes vnto God, to get our ſelues into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with him. He therefore that ſhall well vnderſtand this definition of ſeeking God, ſhall winde himſelfe out of this difficultie. For reward is not to be referred to the dignitie or merit of workes, but to faith. Thus doe all the ſilly gloſes of the Sophiſters fal to the ground: By faith, ſay they, we pleaſe God, becauſe by meriting (forſooth) we haue a purpoſe to pleaſe him But the Apoſtle would carrie vs higher than ſo: to wit, that the conſcience might haue certaine aſſurance in it ſelfe, that it ſhall not looſe the labour in ſeeking God.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7791:103"/>Which aſſurance farre ſurmounteth our capacitie, ſpecially when euery man deſcendeth into the conſideration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For we muſt not onely hold this generall propoſition,
<note place="margin">Knowledge profits not, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be application.</note> that God is the rewarder of them that ſeeke him: but euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt apply the profit &amp; fruit of this doctrine to himſelf in particular: to wit, we muſt know that God reſpecteth vs, that he hath ſuch a tender care of our ſaluation, as he will neuer ſuffer vs to periſh: that he heareth our praiers, and will be our perpetuall &amp; exceeding great reward. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we can haue none of al this without Chriſt, it muſt needs follow of neceſſitie that our faith haue alwaies an eie vnto him, and that in him alone it is to reſt and content it ſelfe.
<note place="margin">Faith muſt content it ſelfe in Chriſt alone.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus from theſe two members we may gather how, and wherefore it is impoſſible to pleaſe God without faith. For iuſtly doeth he hate vs all, ſeeing we euery one of vs are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed by nature: and as for any remedie to doe vs good in this caſe, we haue none at all in our ſelues. Wherefore it is neceſſarie that God preuent vs by his grace.

Now if we would yet haue a more ample de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this point, we muſt begin at this, to wit, that we ſhall neuer benefit our ſelues in any thing whatſoeuer wee expect or enterpriſe, vnleſſe we looke vnto God.
<note place="margin">No other ende of liuing well, but to ſerue to Gods glorie.</note> For there is none other ende of liuing well but to ſerue to his glorie: to which ende we ſhall neuer be able to attaine, vnleſſe the knowledge of him goe before. This is indeed but the one halfe of faith, and would ſtand vs in no great ſtead, vnleſſe confidence be ioyned therewithall. Wherefore, faith is then perfect and entire to obtaine vs fauour with God, when wee haue this ſetled confidence, that we ſecke him not in vaine, and when wee aſſure our ſelues of vndoubted ſaluation in him. Now who is he that will truſt in God to be the rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his merits, vnleſſe hee bee blinded with pride, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with a peruerſe loue of himſelfe? And therefore this confidence, or aſſurance whereof we ſpeake, reſteth it ſelfe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7791:104"/>onely vpon the free grace of God, and not vpon works, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the proper dignitie of men. But ſeeing this grace of God is no where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I do but lightly touch theſe things: euery one may better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of further circumſtances by himſelfe.

<note place="margin">A principle of faith.</note> it is one of the principles of faith, that wee mooue not ſo much a foote, vnleſſe Gods word goe before to ſhew vs the way; nor vnleſſe it giue vs light as a lanterne: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 119.105.

But the Apoſtle contents himſelf to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his perſeuerance in one word, in ſaying that he was <hi>as a ſtranger in the land of promiſe.</hi> For the condition of a ſtranger was contrarie to the promiſe.

For although it was to their great commendation that they had alreadie entertained the aſſurance of the promiſe into their hearts which God had made vnto them of enioying the land, ſo as after ſome good ſpace of time, the thing ſhould be accompliſhed and giuen them indeede: yet in that they did not wholy ſtay themſelues in the hope of that onely, but pearced euen vnto heauen it ſelfe, in this they did ſhew yet a more cleere and euident marke of their faith.

For al the promiſes were founded vpon this, In <hi>Iſaak</hi> ſhall thy ſeede be called, Gen. 21.12: ſo that this being taken away, there remained vnto him no more hope of bleſſing, or of grace. The queſtion is not here then as touching any earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of <hi>Abrahams</hi> eternall ſaluation, yea of the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole world. How many, and how great angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of minde thinke we was this good perſonage caſt into, when it came into his heart that with the loſſe of his ſonnes life, the hope of eternall ſaluation ſhould be cleane cut off and extinguiſhed? And yet notwithſtanding by faith hee went on valiantly (ouercomming all theſe thoughts) to put that in execution which was commanded him of God. If this his conſtancie deſerues the title of an admirable vertue, thus to hold out in the middeſt of ſo many hard incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then doubtleſſe that faith which onely was the cauſe that made <hi>Abraham</hi> thus conſtantly to perſeuere, muſt of neceſſitie deſerue to carrie away the prize.</p>

The Greeke word <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole,</hi> which wee tranſlate <hi>figure,</hi> or ſimilitude, is interpreted diuers waies by the expoſitors. For mine owne part, I take it ſimply for a word of ſimilitude, as, either after a ſort, or ſuch a like ſpeech. For howſoeuer <hi>Iſaak</hi> was not raiſed vp in very deede, yet notwithſtanding he ſeemed after a ſort to be raiſed vp, when hee was ſuddenly and miraculouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by ſuch an vnexpected fauour of God. Yet I reiect not that which others thinke, to wit, that our fleſh which is ſubiect to death, is ſhadowed out in the ramme which was put in the place of <hi>Iſaak.</hi> I confeſſe that to bee true alſo which others teach, that the image of Ieſus Chriſt was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foorth in this offring. But I ſpeake now of that which the Apoſtle meant to ſay, and not of all things that might rightly be gathered.

True it is that hee wrote to the Iewes: but it was to them which were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in diuers regions, and had changed their mother tongue into the Greeke. Now we know that the Apoſtles were not ſo preciſe in this reſpect, but did willingly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the weake who had yet neede of milke. Neither is there any danger in it, prouided that the readers be alwaies brought backe to the pure and natiue reading which the Scripture vſeth.

For in regard there is no reaſon nor counſell in children, they expoſe themſelues to their owne hurt altogether at randon: And yong men alſo are often car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried hither and thither by an inconſiderate heat of blood.

This was as much then as if of his owne free motion he had willingly reiected all. The Apoſtle attributes this vnto faith, becauſe it had beene better for him in reſpect of outward things, to haue remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Egipt; but he was perſwaded that the ſtocke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was bleſſed: of the which bleſſing the onely bare promiſe of God bare witneſſe.

If it be obiected, that it is the dutie of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to inſtruct their children in the worſhippe and feare of God; and therefore it may ſeeme their corrections ought not to be reſtrained to ſo little a while: I anſwer, this is very true: but the Apoſtle ſpeakes here of that houſhold gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we are accuſtomed to call outward policie.

Here therefore wee haue an excellent place, out of which wee learne that there is none other rule of true knowledge, but to reſt all our ſenſes in Chriſt alone. Moreouer, becauſe the Apoſtle had to deale with the Iewes, he ſheweth that Chriſt hath alwaies held the ſame principalitie which he now holds at this day: and that he ſhall be alwaies like vnto himſelfe euen to the end of the world.

It is very certaine that Chriſt was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee manifeſted his power: but the queſtion is now, what it is which the Apoſtle here entreates of. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, that in this ſpeech he aimes at the qualitie (as you would ſay) and not at the eſſence. For here is no diſputing whether Chriſt be eternall with his Father or no, but what his knowledge hath been amongſt men.
